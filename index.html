        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2020/08/05/down-the-podcasting.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-08-05 09:24:25 &#43;0800">Aug 5, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Oh boy, it&rsquo;s happening to me. Some months ago when I made the decision to start doing some podcasting, I did my research and selected the <a href="https://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster">Rode Podcaster</a> microphone as my weapon of choice.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been working fine for me, but at the same time, I&rsquo;ve never been totally certain that it&rsquo;s the right mic for me. I&rsquo;m an amateur and I&rsquo;m learning as I go but the Podcaster struck me as sounding somewhat &lsquo;thin&rsquo;. Plus the gain from the mic was really low. Research suggests this makes absolutely no difference whatsoever to the end result but it still made me curious about other options.</p>

<p>The Podcaster was not cheap so I&rsquo;ve been reticent to spend more money on hardware. Yet I could resist it when I saw a good price on the new <a href="https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/atr2100x-usb">Audio Technica ATR 2100-X</a> which is a combination USB/XLR microphone. I&rsquo;m still in the USB world directly connecting to my iMac. I haven&rsquo;t - and at this stage don&rsquo;t want to - go down the preamp rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Today the ATR-2100x arrived. I&rsquo;ve given it a 45 second test to date, so this doesn&rsquo;t act as a review. What I noticed immediately is that it sounded richer and the gain was definitely higher. However, the dynamic range was therefore more limited compared with the Rode Podcaster. In the test I did, the Podcaster handled it all whereas the ATR-2100x experienced clipping.</p>

<p>I will keep experimenting and will likely record my next episode of <a href="https://andrewcanion.com/podcast/">Keep Practising</a> with the new Audio Technica.</p>

<p>All this is to say, it appears I may be starting the slippery slide towards becoming an audio gearhead. Send help!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today marks the end of a personal era for me; it is the last day of my employment with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia. I&rsquo;ve worked at CCI for 3 months short of 13 years.</p>

<p>When I arrived, my plan was to stay for no more than 2. This speaks to the opportunities I have enjoyed while with the organisation. Over the time I have worked in Policy, Economics, Membership and the Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Programme, plus other temporary assignments.</p>

<p>I have addressed CCI&rsquo;s General Council and the Board, and managed Member Forums and Committees. I have represented the organisation before Federal and State Parliamentary enquiries. I have developed and advocated policy positions, been in the media and analysed government budgets. I&rsquo;m happy that my linkages with CCI are indelibly marked in newspaper articles and the annals of Hansard.</p>

<p>I have worked with people that invested in me, and trusted me. I owe much to many, including John Nicolaou, Frances Parnell, Dana Mason, Kristian Stratton, Jessica Shaw MLA, Barbara Jerkov and James Pearson: all former CCI colleagues who played various roles in my journey, each in different but valuable ways.</p>

<p>Most importantly, at CCI I have been provided a platform to help and support the WA business community. It has been my passion to see successful commercial enterprise operate while maintaining a social compact with the community to provide fair and reasonable opportunity, and improve all our lives as a result. Working to support this has kept me engaged throughout my CCI career.</p>

<p>I am proud to have dedicated 13 years of the one life I have to this organisation. I leave knowing that I will be continuing to deliver the Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Programme. This is a role I enjoy that is aligned with my passion: supporting local firms in their challenge to grow, succeed, and be part of the fabric of community.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2020/06/28/configure-preside-on.html">Configuring Preside on iPadOS</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2020/06/28/configure-preside-on.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-06-28 14:50:26 &#43;0800">Jun 28, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	

<p>In an <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2020/06/16/replicating-heycom-features.html">earlier post</a> I wrote about how I replicated a <a href="https://hey.com/how-it-works/">HEY-style workflow</a> with other email applications.</p>

<p>I thought some detail about how I‚Äôve configured my preferred iPadOS email client, <a href="https://preside.io/">Preside</a> to work in a similar way might be in order.</p>

<p>Preside is an amazing power-user email application for iOS. The application features a myriad of options. The hardest thing about configuring Preside is knowing where the particular setting or customisation might be found within its many nested folders of preferences and settings. What I have found is that my configuration has taken some time and has come together piece-by-piece as I discover another element of Preside‚Äôs functionality. Even now, I don‚Äôt consider my customisation of Preside done. I‚Äôm sure I will continue to tweak it.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to focus on my use of Preside on iPad. While Preside works just the same on iPhone, its settings don‚Äôt sync across the platforms. It‚Äôs been so hard to get the iPad settings right that I don‚Äôt even want to try to replicate it on iPhone. But there‚Äôs nothing stopping my approach from working on either platform. I beg of developer Rich Waters - please give us some method to sync settings!</p>

<p>With that preamble taken care of, on with the show.</p>

<h2 id="dashboard-view">Dashboard View</h2>

<p>My Preside dashboard looks as such:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/cb8b526385.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You see a number of favourite folders and smart searches across the top. A list view of emails down the left hand sidebar and the email content on the right.</p>

<p>How did I get the setup to look exactly this way? I wish I could tell you. Again, with Preside‚Äôs settings being so deep, I can‚Äôt exactly remember what toggles I flipped to get it looking this way. I‚Äôm sorry. I wish I could do better.</p>

<p>I can only show the following setting screen that shows how I have enabled the smart search folders:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/0fdc1ab393.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="my-preside-configuration">My Preside Configuration</h2>

<p>You will note that a number of the folders have ‚Äòsnowflake‚Äô icons next to them. That‚Äôs a feature of Preside, in that each folder can be assigned a ‚Äòtype‚Äô. So I‚Äôve assigned each of my SaneBox-managed folders as a context. This means that Preside will check those folders in the same way that it checks the Inbox, meaning my unread counts are up-to-date.</p>

<p>This screenshot shows the representation of these folders within my IMAP structure:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/b61ed58b84.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking at this, I notice I haven‚Äôt configured my Paper Trail as a context. Maybe this is something I need to resolve.</p>

<p>The ‚ÄòFocus &amp; Reply‚Äô and ‚ÄòSet Aside‚Äô buttons along the top bar of my Dashboard are saved searches. They look for emails that have an IMAP tag assigned to them. You might recall in my post about MailMate, I‚Äôve set up a toolbar button that will add these tags to a chosen email. As these tags are synchronised at the server level via <a href="https://ref.fm/u17095336">Fastmail</a>, Preside can see them, and the tag can be used as a variable in a saved smart search folder, as I‚Äôve done.</p>

<p>What is great about Preside is that it too can apply IMAP tags. I use the ‚Äòlightning bolt‚Äô quick action to do this. I highlight the mail I might wish to ‚ÄòSet Aside‚Äô or ‚ÄòFocus &amp; Reply‚Äô and choose the ‚ÄòTag‚Äô option. This brings up a picker of IMAP tags that I can apply, so I just choose which one I want to use.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/4cbe12d98c.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is a snapshot into how the ‚ÄòFocus &amp; Reply‚Äô smart search was configured:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/fde092c295.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here is an example of how I enabled a SaneBox-managed ‚ÄòPaper Trail‚Äô folder to show:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/19538bd784.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="desktop-level-email-features-on-ipad">Desktop Level Email Features on iPad</h2>

<p>With this configured I feel I‚Äôm very close to the holy grail of a macOS level email workflow on iOS.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve tried many email clients. Some are rudimentary (Outlook). Some are unreliable (Mail.app). Some have opinionated design and callbacks to their own servers (Spark). Some are ridiculously expensive (Superhuman).</p>

<p>Preside is easily the greatest, most complicated and somewhat ugly email client on iOS. It has grown on me the way an ugly dog might find a way into your heart. You know it isn‚Äôt cute, but darn it if it doesn‚Äôt sit when it‚Äôs told and bring the ball back every time. It‚Äôs an email application that can learn new tricks - then you look back and don‚Äôt remember how you taught it. I want to give Preside a good old tickle behind the ear.</p>

<p>These are my thoughts on the 2020 Apple WWDC keynote, presented in the order they occurred as I watched the show.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not yet read any other feedback so these thoughts are non-affected by groupthink:</p>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<ul>
<li>The stagecraft and direction that Apple puts into these shows is amazing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ios">iOS</h2>

<ul>
<li>Widgets on the home screen - finally!</li>
<li>The new messages is great but still relies on everybody having iOS. Many of my friends are Android users, so I end up having to rely on WhatsApp. Even my attempts to transition them to Telegram or Signal failed.</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s a kick ass wheelchair that lady owns.</li>
<li>No new maps for me In Australia.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ipados">iPadOS</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sidebars - like a Mac!</li>
<li>Search on the iPad seems like LaunchBar on the Mac, but it will probably be more like Spotlight, that is, not quite as good.</li>
<li>The new Pencil and <em>Scribble</em> feature looks great</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="apple-watch-appletv">Apple Watch &amp; AppleTV</h2>

<ul>
<li>The scientific capability in Apple is incredible; the resources they can plough into movement sensing for exercise, surround sound, etc. is crazy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="home">Home</h2>

<ul>
<li>Yes! Adaptive lighting. I&rsquo;ve got some LifX bulbs and that app has dawn/dusk settings, but this looks way better.</li>
<li>Is it time for me to get some security video cameras for the house? Whcih ones are best and most future proof?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="macos">macOS</h2>

<ul>
<li>Apple have done translucent menu bars before. I still don&rsquo;t like them.</li>
<li>The spaced out menus are ugly.</li>
<li>I wish I had friends who lived this perfect Apple experience of sharing ETAs with me, sending memojies, etc. It doesn&rsquo;t happen in my world.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been trialling a bunch of different browsers over the past week. Safari might win me back just in time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="apple-silicon">Apple Silicon</h2>

<ul>
<li>Of course it&rsquo;s not called <em>ARM Macs</em>.</li>
<li>Apple have built a hell of a competitive moat with Apple Silicon.</li>
<li>Talk of Linux virtualisation but not Windows. I reckon that must be gone.</li>

<p>To do this I created a new Smart Mailbox with the following mailbox filtering criteria:</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the same mailbox configuration window, but under the &lsquo;Submailboxes&rsquo; tab be sure to select the checkbox to create submailboxes, and choose an appropriate filter. For creating People Pages, I went with the &lsquo;From | Name&rsquo; option.</p>

<p>Basecamp has released their much-anticipated<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> take on email, <a href="https://hey.com">Hey</a>. As a long-time fan of <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> and a light user of their Basecamp Personal<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> product I was interested to see how they were going to address the issue of email.</p>

<p>First off, Hey looks beautiful. Beyond looks it has a number of interesting features to support a healthier and more efficient email workflow.</p>

<p>Hey is a subscription service and I have no issue with this whatsoever. I already pay for email services, preferring to be a customer of an email service provider, rather than the product itself<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. I&rsquo;m a happy user of <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> which I use in conjunction with <a href="https://www.sanebox.com/signup/e46d56be53/c">SaneBox</a>, <a href="https://freron.com/">MailMate</a> on my iMac, and <a href="https://preside.io/">Preside</a> on iOS.</p>

<p>For my purposes then, I&rsquo;m not looking for an email service that will allow me to migrate away from a free-of-charge provider.</p>

<p>Herein lies the problem, at least in terms of me being a customer of Hey. Hey is a standalone service. Unlike a typical email provider it doesn&rsquo;t expose an IMAP interface which other apps can use. If it did this, it would probably lose all the pretty add-ons they have built into the system. Furthermore it doesn&rsquo;t allow the use of a custom domain. You get a nice <code>@hey.com</code> email address but you can&rsquo;t BYO a domain name. A key part of my email infrastructure is owning my domain and emails form a component of that. Moving to Hey would mean stepping away from that lovely setup. I like owning <code>@andrewcanion.com</code> and <code>@canion.me</code>.</p>

<p>For these reasons I quickly ascertained that Hey was not a product for me.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that it doesn&rsquo;t have some clever workflows, and it does look pretty. I can&rsquo;t replicate the pretty, but in watching the <a href="https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI">walkthrough demo by Jason Fried</a> I was fairly certain I could replicate most of the functionality.</p>

<p>So to satisfy my own curiosity I worked with the products I already have - SaneBox and MailMate - to see if I could construct a Hey-style workflow.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s step through the way I built my copy-cat workflow.</p>

<h2 id="triage-yes-or-no">Triage - Yes or No</h2>

<p>Hey lets you select whether new users will be added to your inbox (they call it an &ldquo;Imbox&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not going there).</p>

<p>I use SaneBox for this instead. It does the same sort of triage, using machine learning to determine whether a sender is important to you or not. If it thinks they are, it goes to your inbox. If not, it goes to an alternative &ldquo;SaneLater&rdquo; folder.</p>

<p>I have enabled notifications only for email that lands in my Inbox, so that matches the &lsquo;quiet by design&rsquo; feature of Hey.</p>

<h2 id="focus-reply">Focus &amp; Reply</h2>

<p>Within Hey, this is a neat bundle of messages that are tagged to be dealt with later, most ideally in a focused session of email. They sit as a little visual stack at the bottom of the window. I can&rsquo;t match the visuals, but I should be able to match the functionality with MailMate.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a new Smart Mailbox, named <code>Focus &amp; Reply</code> that looks across All Messages, and filters as per these conditions:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/e34350c219.png" alt="Focus reply" title="focus_reply.png" border="0" width="299" height="211" /></p>

<p>Note the <code>keyword</code> designation. MailMate lets you apply keywords to any email. To make this easier, I&rsquo;ve added a keywords toolbar to MailMate, and have it set to showing the two that are relevant to the Hey-style workflow. I have a magnifying glass for Focus &amp; Reply, and a pushpin for Set Aside.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/b80bedc99b.png" alt="Tags toolbar" title="tags_toolbar.png" border="0" width="110" height="33" /></p>

<p>Now, if I click the icon on any email thread, it is tagged accordingly. I&rsquo;ve enabled a column to show the keywords, so an email might look like this - note the magnifying glass:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/cd3f94a454.png" alt="Tag column" title="tag_column.png" border="0" width="295" height="22" /></p>

<p>Now only emails that I&rsquo;ve tagged by clicking the magnifying glass will appear in the Focus &amp; Reply smart mailbox.</p>

<h2 id="set-aside">Set Aside</h2>

<p>In Hey, Set Aside is designated for mail that you want to reference later. These emails are also taken away from the Inbox view.</p>

<p>As with Focus &amp; Reply, I&rsquo;ve set the pushpin tag to act as the determinant. Together with another Smart Search, I&rsquo;ve got this group of emails configured as such:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/3c4bec0713.png" alt="Set aside" title="set_aside.png" border="0" width="299" height="211" /></p>

<p>But to get the workflow where these are &lsquo;out of view&rsquo; in my regular Inbox, I need to configure my Inbox view as well. So I&rsquo;ve created an <code>Unread Inbox</code>, that works on a series of mailboxes and applies a condition to only show unread mail, as such:</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/94d2368ef4.png" alt="Unread inbox" title="unread_inbox.png" border="0" width="299" height="211" /></p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/981abea5d7.png" alt="Unread inbox conditions" title="unread_inbox_conditions.png" border="0" width="299" height="211" /></p>

<p>Now if I want to reference my Set Aside email, I can click the relevant Mailbox in the Sidebar.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/1ccb39ad53.png" alt="Mailmate sidebar" title="mailmate_sidebar.png" border="0" width="185" height="260" /></p>

<h2 id="the-feed">The Feed</h2>

<p>Hey uses a concept of The Feed almost like a social media scroll of email incorporating newsletters, advisories and all the other non-timely information we get via email.</p>

<p>I created this with the help of SaneBox. All my <code>The Feed</code> smart folder does is show me the contents of the default SaneBox <code>SaneNews</code> folder. It generally knows what should go in there, and I can train it as I go simply by moving mail into that folder as I see fit.</p>

<h2 id="paper-trail">Paper Trail</h2>

<p>The Paper Trail in Hey is for receipts, invoices, and other such transactional information.</p>

<p>Here, I created a custom SaneBox folder to replicate this feature. As I get receipts and things, I will move a few into this email folder and SaneBox will quickly learn and take care of them for me in the future.</p>

<h3 id="other-email">Other Email</h3>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m still using the <code>SaneLater</code> mail folder to catch other less-important email. Looking at Hey, it seems email can only go to the Inbox, The Feed or The Paper Trail.</p>

<p>So for now, I&rsquo;ve either got more features, or more confusion. Yet to be determined which that is.</p>

<h2 id="people-pages">People Pages</h2>

<p>Hey has a concept of people pages where you can see everything that relates to a single individual.</p>

<p>MailMate has me covered quite well here although it doesn&rsquo;t look as pretty as what Hey has achieved.</p>

<p>You will note from the image of my MailMate sidebar above that I have a <code>People Pages</code> folder. When I expand that, MailMate shows me a folder for each individual sender. Click any of those and only email from that person shows in the main window. The image below shows this, with disguised names for privacy reasons.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/3e068fc0f6.png" alt="People sidebar" title="people_sidebar.png" border="0" width="168" height="265" /></p>

<p>With that, I&rsquo;ve got a focused view of each person as well.</p>

<p><em>2020-06-17: I have created <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2020/06/17/addendum-replicating-heycom.html">an addendum to this post</a>, providing some more detail as to how to create the People Pages smart mailbox.</em></p>

<h2 id="attachments">Attachments</h2>

<p>Hey surfaces attachments and looks to do a great job of this.</p>

<p>I am sure that MailMate can do some kind of filtering based on attachment content, but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out a combination that would get this to work effectively<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>However, SaneBox offers the option to connect to a cloud storage provider and save email attachments to a folder in that storage. Optionally, it can strip the attachments from the original email.</p>

<p>I created a connection to OneDrive and now SaneBox is saving email attachments there. To enhance search even further, I&rsquo;m indexing that folder in <a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/">DEVONthink</a> which unlocks the myriad ways of searching and surfacing that DEVONthink offers, while keeping everything neatly in a folder structure.</p>

<p>Fastmail also offers the ability to save attachments to its storage space. I chose OneDrive because I wanted sync to my local drive. OneDrive was the best option as I have the most storage with it, and I&rsquo;m off Dropbox now that their client has become bloat-ware. That&rsquo;s not to say the OneDrive client for Mac is good - it isn&rsquo;t. If only iCloud Drive was an option&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="stickies-notes-and-renaming-threads">Stickies, Notes and Renaming Threads</h2>

<p>Hey has me beat here. I haven&rsquo;t identified a way to create notes against single emails. However this has never been a problem for me in the past. I use a combination of OmniFocus/Drafts/NotePlan to make notes and this is working for me.</p>

<p>The renaming of a thread is nice too, but again, not something I&rsquo;ve ever felt the need for.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>In summary, I think Hey is great. I wish them every success. If it offered the ability to work with my existing infrastructure, I&rsquo;d be tempted. But as it is now the service isn&rsquo;t right for me.</p>

<p>Yet the workflow is solid. By replicating the structure with the combination of tools that I already own/subscribe to I can benefit from the method of work, without the prettiness. I&rsquo;m okay with that.</p>

         	<p><img src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/6f11a607f2.jpg" alt="Looking Older Each Year" /></p>

<p>2020 wasn&rsquo;t meant to be this way. I have distinct memories of working in government when up-beat policy visions with ambitious names like <em>Towards 2020</em> and <em>2020: A Forecast of our Future</em> were being pumped out<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. These reports all had a commonality in that 2020 was guaranteed to be great! As long as we did whatever the document was promoting, from its publish date to 2020, things would be brilliant.</p>

<p>We must have failed miserably because 2020 is a shit show. On this I think we can all agree.</p>

<p>It is within this environment, that today I celebrate(?) my 43rd birthday. Honestly though, I&rsquo;m happy enough to simply celebrate being alive. There have been more worthy souls than I that have had the fortune that I‚Äôve experienced to avoid the range of ways that 2020 is trying to rain death upon us.</p>

<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s unfair to a poor defenceless year. 2020 has nothing against us specifically. Rather we are the architects of our own doom. Whether it be through improper health controls allowing coronavirus to gain a foothold in China, or countries demonstrating a lack of leadership and coordination to corral a community towards effective COVID-19 transmission prevention, or racist hatred leading to people being killed for the skin they&rsquo;re born with, we have created this 2020. This is our reality - not the one that was promoted in the glossy policy brochures in 2003.</p>

<p>And I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned climate change. That doozy is still out there and I don&rsquo;t see our humanity rising to face that challenge in a coordinated way anytime soon. The worst is yet to come.</p>

<p>A good thing about the past year has been that I have figured out who I am. No more am I self-conscious about the person I am or the way I think and perceive the world. I‚Äôm sure this realisation comes to others sooner but for me it has been this 42nd year that has provided me with the answers to my own universe<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This discovery has unlocked confidence in my approach to the world around me. I‚Äôve overcome most vestiges of introversion shyness (except phone calls, I still hate them). Now at 43 years old I feel fully-formed with the confidence to deal with and respond to things I understand, the wisdom to learn about things I don‚Äôt, and the confidence to defer to experts without fear of appearing incompetent.</p>

<p>In turning 43 it‚Äôs not about me anymore. More importantly I&rsquo;ve got two kids - aged 8 and 4 - and they are growing into a world that needs changing. I&rsquo;ve been unsuccessful in making that change happen. Life is a lottery and I didn&rsquo;t win the ‚Äúbecome a leader of a country‚Äù prize. Look at who did and it appears obvious that it often relies on luck ahead of competence, intelligence or desire.</p>

<p>So this final statement I address to my children, and all the others in generations younger than my own. I wish that when you reach your own 43rd birthdays that you have the opportunity to look over the history of your own lives and the society you&rsquo;re in that you can see positive world change.</p>

<p>Just remember that as you&rsquo;re working on all of your <em>Towards 2050</em> vision statements, that it doesn&rsquo;t mean shit if you don&rsquo;t take the hard steps towards enacting the change. Learn from us.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/97dc7de6-940b-11ea-abcd-371e24b679ed">Edward Luce writing for The Financial Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Other scientists have taken note of Bright‚Äôs fate. During the Ebola outbreak in 2014, when Obama‚Äôs administration sent 3,000 US military personnel to Africa to fight the epidemic, the CDC held a daily briefing about the state of progress. It has not held one since early March. Scientists across Washington are terrified of saying anything that contradicts Trump.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe way to keep your job is to out-loyal everyone else, which means you have to tolerate quackery,‚Äù says Anthony Scaramucci, an estranged former Trump adviser, who was briefly his White House head of communications. ‚ÄúYou have to flatter him in public and flatter him in private. Above all, you must never make him feel ignorant.‚Äù&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This brilliant long read article details how the US has essentially become a failed state, led by a megalomaniacal madman.</p>

         	<p>üîó Link Post: &ldquo;Donald Trump Is a Menace to Public Health&rdquo;</p>

<p>The entire article is certainly worth reading. It was hard to pick out excerpts because it‚Äôs all so well written.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/donald-trump-menace-public-health/608449/">Adam Serwer writing for The Atlantic</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Authoritarian leaders prize loyalty over expertise, and part of the way such leaders determine loyalty is through demanding sycophantic praise from underlings, smoking out those unwilling to bend the knee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Democracy can be thought of as a garden; if you don‚Äôt tend to it, it doesn‚Äôt take long to be overtaken by the weeds of alternative, less-preferred civic models.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Trumpist media outlets, by contrast, have created a bubble of unreality where nothing but the most effusive praise of Trump is acceptable, where anyone who disagrees with or criticizes the president is part of a grand conspiracy to destroy him, and where the only facts that exist are those that reflect well on the president.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having denied that the coronavirus was a major issue for months, the president sought to recast himself as an oracle, and conservative media followed suit, shifting their tone from downplaying the severity of the pandemic to praising the heroic efforts of the president to address it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm old fashioned in that I like my news to give me the news, not an opinion. Right-wing media is out of control - pretending to be news but actually delivering propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The president is a relentless scammer at heart, and even during a pandemic he will attempt to get what he wants while providing as little as possible in return, as though he were trying to save cash by stiffing a contractor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This pretty much nails it. Everything is for personal gain; not for the collective good. In Trump‚Äôs world, everything is a zero-sum game.</p>

<p>It used to be said that, ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not Boeing, I‚Äôm not going‚Äù. Nowadays, I feel more comfortable with Airbus.</p>

<p>Paul offers some thoughts and insights regarding Trump, from a British perspective.

<p>&ldquo;A true disruptive innovation, he taught, first appealed only to a niche market and appeared less attractive than the powerful incumbent it eventually usurped. In fact, the incumbent typically looked down on it as inconsequential until it ate up huge swaths of its market share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This article rightly focuses on Christensen&rsquo;s impactful theory of disruption.</p>

<p>In my work I often crib Christensen&rsquo;s case study about the utility of a milkshake as part of the &lsquo;jobs to be done&rsquo; theory.</p>

Since the podcast ended Aaron Mahnke has gone on to fame and fortune with <a href="https://www.lorepodcast.com/">Lore</a> and Dave Caolo has moved on to <a href="https://www.rebootgamelab.com">other projects</a>.</p>

<p>Leveraging the notes posted by Shawn Blanc, I see that the podcast noted working from home as thus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Working from home isn‚Äôt always about notebooks, apps and office furniture. Much of it happens in the head, between fighting distraction, staying focused and keeping things organised. In this episode, Aaron and Dave chat about leaving work at work (even when it‚Äôs in your home) and doing a mind-sweep to keep things clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a challenge worth remembering, particularly now in 2019 when ubiquitous networking and powerful mobile devices makes it so easy to do work not only from home, but from anywhere at anytime. There is a clear risk of dedicating too much time to work because it‚Äôs possible. Yet this doesn‚Äôt make it the right choice. We really need to protect our leisure time.</p>

<p>You thought <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2019/11/29/religion.html">religion</a> was a dangerous topic? No, I&rsquo;ve left the really dangerous one until last. Today, let&rsquo;s talk politics.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="my-origin-story">My origin story</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in politics since I was 12 or 13 years old. Perhaps influenced by my conservative parents, and having grown up in an Australia where for the length of my memory Labor had been in government, I felt Labor were taking it all for granted.</p>

<p>I determined that Labor were not for me. The Australian economy was in recession and it felt that our family had been forgotten.</p>

<h2 id="impact-of-education">Impact of education</h2>

<p>Time moved on and I began to take a different outlook on life. I realised that our family was living on the margins in low-income outer suburbia.</p>

<p>I did well enough at school that I was able to attend university. This was a foundation for self-improvement and growth. It helped me begin to see there was a broader world beyond that in which I had grown up.</p>

<p>I came to see that were it not for the efforts of the Labor Party to make university education affordable for everybody irrespective of their family situation, societal status or upbringing, I would never have been able to afford to go to university, even if I was clever enough. I also saw the people who were involved in the Liberal Party - and I knew they were nothing like me. My suburban story was foreign to them.</p>

<p>The Labor Party, on the other hand, was full of people that I could relate to, who had similar stories to mine.</p>

<p>My involvement in the Labor Party accelerated when I met my future wife, Hannah, who happened to be the daughter of Kim Beazley. He was the Leader of the Labor Party in Australia&rsquo;s national parliament at the time. It&rsquo;s not good for romance if you vote against your girlfriend&rsquo;s father!</p>

<p>Ironically, I didn&rsquo;t meet Hannah through any political connection or event. We met in a nightclub. Those were the days!</p>

<h2 id="politics-engrained">Politics engrained</h2>

<p>That was in 1999. Since then I&rsquo;ve been involved in politics in ways and to degrees that my childhood self could never have imagined.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on campaigns, I&rsquo;ve door-knocked, I&rsquo;ve called voters. I&rsquo;ve twice supported my wife as a candidate at State and Federal elections. Unfortunately she was not victorious, despite running excellent campaigns and being generally well-regarded. The big swings that are needed to change a seat in politics simply didn&rsquo;t eventuate.</p>

<p>It is easy to get caught up in the game of politics. When that happens to me, I think back on my own story. I believe the purpose of politics is to help communities, and enable people to have a fair and equal opportunity to become the best version of themselves. It&rsquo;s about allowing kids like me living in poor suburbs have a chance to get an education. For me, an education unlocked employment opportunities and life improvements that I would not have ever imagined. It also helped the nation, because being qualified to get higher paying jobs I&rsquo;ve been able to pay a lot more income tax than I otherwise would have.</p>

<p>Governments and politicians are servants of the people. When this responsibility is forgotten the system breaks down. When Paul Keating was in charge and the recession was in full swing, I looked at the situation around me and felt forgotten. When I look around now I feel that many, many more are forgotten. That needs to be brought to their attention. If it is, then perhaps they will elect to have a government that will be an effective servant who acts in their best interests.</p>

<p>My life has always been connected to religion and it has played a formative role in my upbringing.</p>

<p>Baptised Anglican, and the son of an Anglican minister, I remember sitting through interminably boring sermons and church services that seemed to go forever. I also remember visiting the church with my Mom and sitting on her lap and steering our car through the parking lot while she dealt with the pedals.</p>

<p>Then our family transitioned away from Anglicanism towards a Pentecostal approach to religion, and we attended an Assemblies of God church. My memories of that church was that it was more interesting than the Anglican Church. Looking back, I <em>think</em> it drifted further towards the charismatic ‚Äòmodern‚Äô approach to Pentecostalism. This was a long time ago, and I was growing through my teen years, so I can‚Äôt confirm if that is an accurate assessment - but it is my memory.</p>

<p>At this point I drifted away from organised religion.</p>

<p>Later I married a Catholic girl, so I have become familiar with the yin to the Anglican‚Äôs yang. I actually don‚Äôt mind the Catholic service - except for all the random sitting and standing, and then some kneeling for good measure. I always just copy the person next to me. Of course, both the Anglicans and Catholics strike fear into the heart of all introverts with their ‚Äòpeace be with you‚Äô bit. Really, must we?</p>

<hr />

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I‚Äôve had two work meetings divert into topics of religion and churches. This doesn‚Äôt worry me at all. What I find interesting is that Australia is a secular country, and rarely in my working life has religion ever come up in a work context before.</p>

<hr />

<p>At this time our country is being led by a Prime Minister who declares his faith. What I find unfortunate is that this faith is tied to the Hillsong <del>church</del> business. I cannot abide this organisation. Their ‚Äòprosperity doctrine‚Äô has worked for their founders who have become obscenely rich, and (I believe) powerful behind the scenes despite having no formalised legitimacy. The Hillsong business spreads a message that deviates far from the original word and intention of Jesus. Cherry picking gospel and turning church into a rock concert doesn‚Äôt seem the answer to me.</p>

<p>Now they have the ear of our Prime Minister; and I‚Äôm sure they tell their followers that is further evidence of the truth of their mission. I‚Äôm not so believing.</p>

<hr />

<p>Religion has forever played a part in keeping civilisation in order. It has provided guidelines for appropriate lifestyles when there has been no governance system or rule of law to steer societies.</p>

<p>Religion has been an enabler of great deeds. Religion has been a driving force for wars and hatred.</p>

<p>There is no doubt it is a complex issue. We will either get all the answers at our death, or we won‚Äôt.</p>

<p>I hope my children have a good future. Challenges confront them large and small.</p>

<p>Some of my immediate hopes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>they don&rsquo;t fall in with the wrong crowd.</li>
<li>they develop deep friendships - the type where you can trust the other with your deepest secrets and fears.</li>
<li>they don&rsquo;t fall down a drug vortex.</li>
<li>they find fun in their childhood.</li>
<li>they muddle through their difficult teen years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any prior generation to mine could probably stop there. Yet now I feel like our kids are faced with an existential crisis, the likes of which we have never battled before. I fear that the world they grow up in will be damaged and impacted by anthropogenic global warming, that will bring down all sorts of issues. In this sense, I hope:</p>

<ul>
<li>their generation can actually recognise and respond to this &lsquo;wicked problem&rsquo;, as economist Ross Garnaut described climate change.</li>
<li>they don&rsquo;t experience a dramatically less hospitable world in which to live.</li>
<li>they don&rsquo;t experience wars and upheaval resulting from large-scale migration from inhospitable locations and a fight for diminishing resources.</li>
<li>they can still eat fish caught from the sea, hoping that they haven&rsquo;t been fished to extinction.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s a worrying world. Some of my hopes for my children I can influence through effective parenting. Others are completely outside of my direct control. All I have is <em>hope</em>.</p>

<p>I get frustrated when I lose something basic, like keys, glasses or my wallet. I have a designated ‚Äòhome location‚Äô for these items. Despite that, they still seem to have a tendency to disappear from time to time.</p>

<p>It is the most frustrating kind of loss, because I know they have to be around somewhere. But that somewhere could be anywhere. The loss usually seems to occur when I‚Äôm in a rush to get out of the house. Murphy‚Äôs Law, hard at work.</p>

<p>Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄòFind My‚Äô service is great for lost devices. Also great for lost spouses - it‚Äôs not stalking when you‚Äôre married! Unfortunately this service doesn‚Äôt work for keys and wallets. I‚Äôve been tempted to buy some <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/">tiles</a>, but I‚Äôm never feeling the pain of the loss when I‚Äôve considered buying them, so I put it off.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm interested in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/apple-bluetooth-tracker-airtag-name/">rumours about Apple developing a similar tile tracking device</a>. Since I‚Äôm already all-in with Apple devices I imagine these would have great integration with everything else in the house. It might even make losing things fun, because no doubt it would integrate with the Find My app and probably make some gentle pinging noise to help me locate the item.</p>

<p>Losing things will always be annoying but if we can get some cool tech gadgets to offset that, then I‚Äôm all for it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I literally finished writing this post, got up to put my bag away, and realised my wallet was missing. I found it, but not before suffering a mild anxiety attack. So frustrating,</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not a sneaker head by any means. Though there was a period when I was a teenager that I did pay a little more attention to the shoe world, and basketball shoes in particular.</p>

<h2 id="basketball-shoes">Basketball Shoes</h2>

<p>This was the era of Reebok Pumps and the original Air Jordans. When shoes were big and high tops were really high. Fluoro colours were cool. Modern design technology was getting started and companies were testing the limits.</p>

<p>The shoe I desired most during this era were the Nike Air Jordan V, in white. The blacks weren‚Äôt nearly as good. The white ones featured a silver feather inset on the side, and the way they had a thick side sole with some red flames just made them look brilliant. The mid-cut ankle made them look even more streamlined.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> These shoes were amazing. As much as I wanted them, though, our family budget said no.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2019/0e8d01a5ae.jpg" alt="Jordan 5" title="Jordan_5.jpeg" border="0" width="299" height="189" /></p>

<p>I did ultimately get a pair of Jordans. Unfortunately, they were the Air Jordan VIIs, which were about the ugliest version of Jordan‚Äôs released through that era. Oh well.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2019/a0f42d7ce6.jpg" alt="Jordan 7" title="Jordan_7.jpeg" border="0" width="299" height="170" /></p>

<p>My favourite basketball shoes ever were a pair of blue Reeboks. They were a lightweight material and were low-cut. They were incredibly comfortable. I was obsessed with blue shoes and these ones I got were fantastic. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt remember the name of them at all. I‚Äôve tried searching for them, to no avail. They were the greatest shoes I‚Äôve ever worn, though.</p>

<p>Having worn these and many other basketball shoes over the years, I will say that Nike are the least comfortable shoe, while Adidas and Reebok tie for most comfortable.</p>

<h2 id="dress-boots">Dress Boots</h2>

<p>Outside basketball shoes, I had a pair of Doc Marten 8-holes, that were English-made. In fact, this was around 1997 so I don‚Äôt even think they were made anywhere <em>but</em> the UK. In any case, these shoes were absolute hell for about two weeks, ripping my feet up creating many blisters. I pushed through and they became the most comfortable boot I‚Äôve ever owned.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2019/0c17434131.jpg" alt="Doc marten" title="Doc_marten.jpg" border="0" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p>Now I‚Äôm all grown up, and my favourite shoes now are a pair of RM Williams. These are great to wear but I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say they‚Äôre not as comfortable as the DMs.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2019/bedc4e657f.jpg" alt="Rm williams" title="Rm_williams.jpg" border="0" width="224" height="300" /></p>

<p>Money is the great enabler. Its presence enables people to climb out of poverty. Others can build their ego collecting it. Some feel good giving it away. In acting as a proxy for elements of human behaviour and achievement, money allows us to communicate status, success and worth.</p>

<p>Money is a human construct. It is a renewable resource. It&rsquo;s a shared fiction that relies on us to all believe for it to work. Fortunately we well and truly believe in it. In fact, we practically worship at its altar. It is the central and universal element upon which all of us must give consideration. Criminals, office workers, paramedics. Whatever one&rsquo;s role in life, money is at the core.</p>

<p>Many years ago I was employed as an Advisor to our State Government‚Äôs Minister for Planning and Infrastructure. This followed previous work in the State Department of Transport and for a large grains cooperative which built, managed and utilised transport and logistics infrastructure.</p>

<p>Infrastructure is often taken for granted It‚Äôs reasonable to suggest that‚Äôs when infrastructure is working at its best. When people start talking about traffic or fresh water or power failures it usually means something has gone wrong at an infrastructure level. Not enough road capacity has been built, the desalination plant has failed or the baseload power generator failed to get a steady supply of fuel. There are teams of people across all the various infrastructure providers responsible for ensuring citizens don‚Äôt think about them or their service. Mostly, these people do a good job. Infrastructure management relies on effective processes driving preventative maintenance schedules. Combined with regular capital works investment to upgrade, improve and stay ahead of the demand curve, infrastructure ideally stays ahead of demand.</p>

<p>The ingenuity of humans, that we are able to build, design and operate infrastructure so effectively is incredible. Additionally we have been able to develop an economic system that incentivises delivery of services. This includes the ability for government to step in as a supplier where market conditions don‚Äôt support commercial operations.</p>

<p>Infrastructure is also the enabler of unrelated money-making projects. Without basics such as power, water and Internet access, Australia couldn‚Äôt support the development and operations of companies like Atlassian and Fastmail, to suggest two technology-based business examples. Infrastructure enables these and all other firms to employ people, generate profit, and pay taxes. Infrastructure firms, however, rarely (ever?) are afforded the status that is probably deserving of them. Mike Cannon-Brookes has become a billionaire but I can‚Äôt find any CEOs of infrastructure firms that have become billion-dollar poster children for their industry. Rather, infrastructure firms are the staid companies that superannuation firms love to buy shares in, as they deliver a boring, regular dividend stream.</p>

<p>So here‚Äôs to the infrastructure, and the people that work on it, that makes our lives better each and every day. Please keep up your yeoman‚Äôs work&hellip; even if it goes unnoticed and under-appreciated.</p>

<p>John Siracusa built an empire talking about toasters, but what about the toast?</p>

<p>I like a slice of toast that is crispy on the outer but remains soft under that toasted exoskeleton. The bread should be a golden brown. I don&rsquo;t want no black bits.</p>

<p>Onto that toast, slather some butter. It really should be butter. Margarine is a substitute that allows sufficient oiliness to support the subsequent spread of a condiment but in itself doesn&rsquo;t taste good. A nice piece of toast is one that has butter - and only butter - lathered across it. This toast can be eaten as so and should bring some sweet joy to your morning.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t want two pieces of buttered toast though. That buttered slice is the entree to the second more flavoursome slice. Here you can go two ways. If you want something sweet, run with peanut butter. I think it needs to be crunchy peanut butter and I want it spread on thick. Remember, it still needs butter first. Then get the peanut butter thick and gooey. If you&rsquo;re going to have it go hard, or go home.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t fancy the sweet option, then the umami of Vegemite is what you need. The slightly salty, bitter taste of Vegemite is great. Vegemite <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2019/01/29/after-enjoying-vegemite.html">has had its problems of late</a>, but they do seemed to have reverted back to a better quality more recently. It&rsquo;s not what it once was, but it is showing improvement.</p>

<p>You need to be careful not to spread Vegemite too thick. This is the mistake visiting Americans always make. Vegemite is the anti-peanut butter. Spread it thin.</p>

<p>Those two slices of toast, prepared that way, will get you off to a great start in the morning.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always watching and playing sport. As a kid, I tried most sports that entered my world view. I can remember playing:</p>

<ul>
<li>volleyball</li>
<li>cricket</li>
<li>basketball</li>
<li>tennis</li>
<li>football (Australian Rules)</li>
<li>soccer</li>
<li>baseball</li>
<li>swimming</li>
<li>athletics (I loved high jump, hated running)</li>
</ul>

<p>The sports I really enjoyed were cricket and basketball. If I&rsquo;d had a better experience with cricket, I probably would have stuck at it longer. I loved bowling and would be happy doing it for hours on end.</p>

<p>The sport I excelled at was basketball. I was an athletic white guy. I am 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; and was able to throw down some good dunks. Although my mates were always frustrated that I seemed happier firing from beyond the three-point line! I maintain I was ahead of my time - look at how the game is played now.</p>

<p>Unfortunately basketball has taken its toll on my body. I&rsquo;ve got an ankle that won&rsquo;t bend properly, hips that are creaking, and knees that have lost their cartilage so they crack and pop as I climb stairs, misaligned fingers and a thumb that strains with the slightest effort.</p>

<p>Despite all those injuries and the awareness that things are going to get worse, I wouldn&rsquo;t change anything. I loved playing basketball so much. For me it went beyond a sport; it was a lifestyle. I made so many friends; I have amazing memories of playing with some incredible players and I&rsquo;ve met some impressive people.</p>

<p>The two most famous basketball people I&rsquo;ve met are probably Luc Longley and Phil Jackson. Ironically, neither of these encounters came because I was a basketball player. Rather, they came about because my father-in-law was Australia&rsquo;s Ambassador to the United States of America and both me and those basketball celebrities were at a gala &ldquo;G&rsquo;Day USA&rdquo; event.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m transitioning to the next phase of my sporting life. I am watching my eldest boy try a variety of sports. To date, it seems he is enjoying cricket the most. I wonder what my younger kid will get interested in?</p>

<p>Who set these prompts anyway? <a href="https://www.andrewcanion.com">That guy</a> should be put to the sword for this one. I can‚Äôt think of anything to write about ‚Äòunrequited‚Äô.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago I wrote some thoughts on <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2019/11/19/love.html">love</a>. So this post could be those thoughts, unreturned?</p>

<p>In searching for some inspiration about what to write about, I did discover that ‚ÄòUnrequited‚Äô was the title of an episode of The X-Files. It was also the title of a low-budget movie that doesn‚Äôt look very good.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>My thanks to The Beastie Boys for their guest introduction.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not a fighter; never have been. I recall Jason Bulpitt (may he <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/wa/tired-driver-jailed-over-deadly-muchea-crash-ng-645b5ee08d8e37471c9cfffb2b512c05">Rest In Peace</a>) squaring up to me in the school playground one day. I countered by being a smart-arse, running my mouth. Intelligent diatribe was my competitive advantage - not fist fights.</p>

<p>This approach to fighting has probably led to my engagement in politics over the years. A focus on the verbal stoush ahead of the physical kind. The kind of fight I might have a chance of winning. Plus, winning can benefit a lot of people.</p>

<p>Political fights can be hard and deflating. They can also be exhilarating and rewarding. That‚Äôs why we keep coming back for more. It‚Äôs good to fight for a better country.</p>

<p>Love is a super-complicated topic. I know I love my wife, I love my kids. But truth be told, I don‚Äôt know <em>how</em> I know that I love them.</p>

<p>I know that I love, in a technical sense. Yet I only <em>feel</em> it rarely. To be fair, I do occasionally experience an overwhelming sense of affection that pulls at my insides. This is probably the truest expression of love. But I don‚Äôt get that often. Is that a standard, everyday feeling for others? Am I missing what other people experience?</p>

<p>I wonder if others have a clearer understanding of what love is, or how it feels. Perhaps I‚Äôm missing out on the feeling of <em>emotional</em> love. It‚Äôs like my rational side gets in the way of my emotional side.</p>

<p>Heavy stuff. A bit too daunting to think more deeply about at this point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a gamer; this month I unsubscribed from Apple Arcade because I wasn&rsquo;t playing any of the games on offer despite a number of them being good. It&rsquo;s an opportunity cost issue. There are only so many hours in a day and I find enjoyment doing other things ahead of gaming&hellip; most of the time.</p>

<p>I say that because rarely I do become obsessed with a game. My most recent example is <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. With that game, I would sneak away with my son&rsquo;s Switch and play it for hours. At first I was making my way through the game naturally. Then as I progressed, I got more serious and downloaded an iOS app to help me track the locations I had been, and which areas I still needed to unlock.</p>

<p>I continued to upgrade my character, beyond that which was necessary to claim victory over the big boss. I didn&rsquo;t know that at the time of course, but given how relatively easy the final boss battle was, I&rsquo;d say that I had swung the scales significantly in my favour.</p>

<p>Zelda was an epic game. It captured my mind for months. It was an expensive game but on an entertainment per hour basis, was incredibly cheap. I don&rsquo;t know when I will encounter another game that captivates me in that that way but I&rsquo;m sure it will happen, I&rsquo;ll become a gamer for a month or two, then go back to normal non-gamer life.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not one for parties; my introversion means I‚Äôm diametrically opposed to them.</p>

<p>Having said that, I‚Äôm actually attending a party this afternoon/evening. It is a 60th birthday celebration though and should be a nice one. It is incorporating a showing of <em>Blade Runner</em>. I haven‚Äôt seen that movie in about 20 years, so I‚Äôm interested to see my interpretation of it now.</p>

<p>Another party issue arising is planning to host a 4th birthday party for our youngest son. Trying to decide what to do for that is a puzzler as well. Do we host it at home, or out somewhere? Who to invite? We don‚Äôt have friends who have kids of a similar age, but it won‚Äôt be much of a party if he doesn‚Äôt have some similar-aged kids around. We need to get moving on the planning so we can get the invites out, but we‚Äôre having trouble generating motivation. That‚Äôs not good parenting, is it!</p>

<p>Our family might be about to lose our second animal of the year to old age. Our Standard Poodle, Jeff, is not holding up so well. He has developed large cysts under his skin, his teeth are wearing out and now he seems to have hurt his paw.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we had to say goodbye to our Airedale Terrier, Indi. Her absence seems to have accelerated the decline of Jeff. He relied on her so much to be top dog and I don&rsquo;t think he has been the same since she has been gone.</p>

<p>I recall a couple of months ago when we were at the dog beach with Jeff, and we saw another Airedale Terrier. Jeff went running up to it, and you could just tell from his body language that he thought it was Indi. A sniff and a closer look confirmed that it was a stranger. If a dog can look deflated, Jeff did in that moment.</p>

<p>We bring animals into our lives knowing that it&rsquo;s not forever and that one day we will need to make hard decisions about their future. The knowledge of that, however, doesn&rsquo;t make the reality of the situation any easier.</p>

<p>About three years ago we did a house renovation. We had our kitchen gutted and rebuilt, our bathrooms reconfigured, wood floors sanded and interior walls painted, and a new front deck.</p>

<p>A huge job already was made bigger because we had to move all of our furniture into storage and move our family into a short-term rental for the duration of the project. It reminded me why I don‚Äôt like moving house. Packing is the worst!</p>

<p>The renovation grew our mortgage significantly but improved our quality of life. We spend so much time in our home that making it a comfortable environment was worth the investment.</p>

<p>We had an excellent builder on the project. I‚Äôm no handyman so it was absolutely necessary to employ a professional to do the job right. That‚Äôs an element of our renovation for which I hold no regrets. It‚Äôs also a standing principle of mine: if you‚Äôre not good at something and have no interest in learning the skill, pay somebody to deliver. Money is a resource that can be deployed strategically to save your own frustration and heartache. When it comes to a renovation, if I were doing it myself there would be plenty of both. I‚Äôd rather be without the money!</p>

<p>Recycling is kind of a big deal in our house. Our council runs a three bin system for rubbish management: one bin for food and organics, one for rubbish, and a third for recyclables.</p>

<p>My wife Hannah works in the recycling industry. She is the <a href="https://warrrl.com.au/careers-at-warrrl/?paged=0">Head of External Relations</a> at <em>Western Australia Return Recycle Renew</em> (WARRRL). This organisation has responsibility for establishing a new container deposit scheme for our State. That will mean that for every drink container brought back to a recycling point, 10 cents is given to the recycler.</p>

<p>As well as reducing the amount of waste going to landfill, or the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the scheme provides an opportunity for community engagement. I could choose to have my recycled containers benefit an organisation that elects to participate. For instance, if my son&rsquo;s local Scout group gets involved they can use it as a fund-raising measure.</p>

<p>Western Australia is a geographically <em>huge</em> State and this is rolling out across it all. Hannah and the entire WARRRL team have been working hard to get this initiative up and running and I am proud of the work they are doing. It will be exciting when the system is ready to launch!</p>

<p>My favourite beverage is coffee. There is no contest. There is not much better than an Australian flat white.</p>

<p>Italian coffee is great but it&rsquo;s a transitory drink. You get it at the bar, drink it and leave. Don&rsquo;t sit down because it will cost you a fortune.</p>

<p>American coffee is bad. It&rsquo;s either sweetened and flavoured to the point where its more milkshake than coffee, or its drip-filtered and been sitting in storage for a while.</p>

<p>Australian coffee has the quality of the Italian style, but there is a social norm of sitting down at the coffee shop to drink it. Our baristas are great at frothing the milk to achieve micro-foam rather than aerated fluff, and we benefit from a delicious crema when they pour.</p>

<p>Regarding other beverages, I enjoy sharing a pot of tea at home with my wife. She is addicted to tea and doesn&rsquo;t drink coffee at all. I think that&rsquo;s weird, but there you go. I rarely drink soft drink. Perhaps an occasional Coke Zero. Never in my life have I had a Red Bull or other super-caffeinated beverage. I can&rsquo;t see how they can possibly be good for me.</p>

<p>A smell can be a most evocative sense. It can stimulate memory, facilitate calm or revulsion, or provide us with timely information.</p>

<p>If I smell new carpet, I am transported back to my Year 1 classroom which had been renovated and new carpet laid. That&rsquo;s an associated formed around 35 years ago. The smell of a basketball stadium: that combination of sweat, <a href="https://www.dencorub.com.au">dencorub</a>, and timber treatment to this day hastens my heart beat.</p>

<p>Today I was between meetings so I had the opportunity to park near the beach for a few minutes. As I opened the car window, my olfactory senses were treated to that wonderful scent of salt air traveling on a warm breeze. That is much nicer smell than that of a dirty nappy, which over the past 8 years I&rsquo;ve become far to familiar with.</p>

<p>A smell I miss is the cooking of roast beef and yorkshire pudding. That was a staple of my childhood diet but I don&rsquo;t have the time or inclination to make it myself these days.</p>

<p>Of all our senses, I think smell is the most associative. I don&rsquo;t think vision, hearing, touch or taste can transport us back in time or recall memories of a person or place the way a smell can. We should probably take more time out to appreciate our noses.</p>

<p>I miss my childhood. It was such a different era; it&rsquo;s hard to recognise my childhood as an experience compared with those of my kids.</p>

<p>The memories of my childhood seem like something that should be written off as me looking back through rose-coloured glasses. But I contest that not everything was great and nice, but it really was what retro throwbacks show the 1980s to be.</p>

<p>Some of my key memories across a relatively wide age range include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leaving the house to ride my bike around the streets without saying where I was going. I didn&rsquo;t know where I was going - how could I tell others?</li>
<li>Staying out until dusk then going home to either my own home, or my friend&rsquo;s house for dinner. I think I almost split my time 50:50.</li>
<li>Riding our BMX bikes through citrus orchards where dirt bike jumps had been constructed, and getting mega air.</li>
<li>Playing pick-up basketball all day, and sweating litres.</li>
<li>Playing multi-day games of Monopoly. Leaving it set up to pick up the next day.</li>
<li>Climbing trees - but never as well as my friend.</li>
<li>Spending hours throwing a ball against a wall, then playing a solid cricket stroke when it bounced back to me.</li>
<li>Backyard camping for days (maybe even weeks?) on end. We had a big block, so we could pitch the tent in the back yard and be invisible from the house.</li>
<li>Playing a season of Under 13&rsquo;s cricket and being completely isolated by the other boys - and the coach. (Things are much better in this regard now, it seems.)</li>
<li>Abseiling, rock climbing and other cool activities at school that probably wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed anymore.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m proud of my childhood. I had enough freedom to be adventurous and I managed to avoid any major dangers. I learnt to know my limits and stay within them. I had a sense of place in my suburb.</p>

<p>If I had a time machine, I would happily go back to the early 1980s and do it all again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a concerted effort this year to increase my volume of book reading.</p>

<p>In recent years my reading has been dominated by web pages, articles and RSS feeds. This resulted in a decline in my book reading - something I used to do a lot of.</p>

<p>To track my reading and add some motivation I set a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/8863-2019-reading-challenge">target on Goodreads.</a>. This has worked because I&rsquo;ve read 23 books against my target of 20 - a target I revised upwards mid-year.</p>

<p>Another thing that has helped has been an Audible subscription. I think it&rsquo;s fair enough to consider listening to audiobooks as reading. I&rsquo;m still consuming the story; it actually takes longer than reading the printed version, and it allows me to read in &lsquo;gaps&rsquo; of time, notably driving.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my return to reading. Once more I feel like my mind is being stretched and my imagination activated.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve got problems with my Catalina install. I have <code>wifidiagnostics</code> files multiplying like tribbles in my <code>private/var/tmp/</code> folder. With each of these files weighing in between 200Mb and 400Mb, my entire SSD is being swamped with these files, to the point of the operating system being crippled for lack of disk space.</p>

<p>I thought a short-term interim solution would be to set up a Hazel watch script to automatically trash these files as they are created. I&rsquo;ve hit a problem with this as well, because they are system files the user doesn&rsquo;t have adequate permissions to delete them, so Hazel isn&rsquo;t able to do it. I haven&rsquo;t yet figured out how to combine some kind of <code>chmod</code> or <code>chown</code> command within Hazel to get it to change permissions and then delete the files.</p>

<p>In searching for a solution on the web, I&rsquo;ve only found <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/373378/wifidiagnostics-files-filling-up-drive-even-with-logging-disabled">one other mention of the problem</a>.</p>

<p>I have deleted all my wifi settings and rebuilt them. I have deleted a security profile I had. I have toggled the enable/disable diagnostics by option-clicking the wifi menubar icon to see if that might rewrite a <code>.plist</code> file. Nothing has resolved it to date.</p>

<p>I think this must be an underlying bug in the wifi networking frameworks of Catalina, but that&rsquo;s above my pay grade.</p>

<p>I hope it&rsquo;s resolved in a future update. For now, it&rsquo;s an annoying bug, and another indicator that Apple&rsquo;s software quality is not where it should be.</p>

<p>There is so much high-quality television programming available now. We have Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Free to Air, etc. There was a time when it was necessary to find things off the back of a truck. I think those days are almost gone.</p>

<p>This overwhelming choice has led to a strange outcome, in that I‚Äôm actually watching <em>less</em> TV than I probably ever have. I feel like the onslaught is overwhelming so I‚Äôm just going to close my eyes and block my ears and hum to myself.</p>

<p>The competition now is for attention. As all the streaming services vie for our television attention budget, the television budget is being attacked by gaming, web browsing, reading, exercise and whatever else there is to do in recreation time.</p>

<p>My sacred cow of TV shows over many years has been <em>Survivor</em>. I would always find time for this show. My wife and I would watch it together. Now, we are 2 seasons behind in that. If we can‚Äôt keep up with that show, what hope have I got of ever finishing Season 3 of <em>Stranger Things</em>?</p>

<p><em>Day 8 of Blogvember. A <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2019/10/23/blogvember-prompt-list.html">full list of prompts</a> for the month is available.</em></p>

<p>This week I&rsquo;ve had a massive technology upgrade. I&rsquo;ve moved from a 2013 MacBook Pro (the generation of MacBooks which had great keyboards), to a 2019 27&rdquo; iMac. I had been deferring this computer upgrade for ages, as I dithered between getting a new MacBook (and which variant?), an iMac or even a mac mini. I was hoping the iMac would gain the T2 security chip and possibly a new display with reduced bezels. I was waiting for Apple to return to manufacturing laptops with scissor mechanisms in their keyboards. By the end of October, none of those had come to pass. All the while I was becoming more frustrated with the slowness of my MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>I bit the bullet and bought the iMac. I&rsquo;ve had a 27&rdquo; Apple Cinema Display for years, so I&rsquo;m used to a big screen. Yet this is the first time I&rsquo;ve had retina resolution at this size. For my ageing eyes it is incredible. In use the iMac feels much faster with my old machine. I know it&rsquo;s not near the processing grunt of an iMac Pro - but I don&rsquo;t do video, podcasting or programming. For my productivity app usage and a bit of photo editing (and less than I used to do) this is plenty powerful enough for me.</p>

<p>A quick run of <a href="https://www.geekbench.com">Geekbench</a> on this Mac, compared with what I found in the Geekbench browser for my old laptop, highlights the difference:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left"></th>

<th align="left">MacBook Pro</th>

<td align="left">710</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">Multi Core</td>
<td align="left">4875</td>
<td align="left">1565</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>It&rsquo;s not all speeds and feeds, though. This new iMac feels nicer, supports newer features such as Sidecar, and has cleared clutter on my desk!</p>

<h2 id="technology-upgrade-cycle">Technology upgrade cycle</h2>

<p>All technology needs a regular upgrade cycle. Technology ages out and the industry moves forward. Inevitably devices need to be changed out. Obsolescence generally occurs before devices fail.</p>

<p>Over my most recent technology cycle, I&rsquo;ve been depreciating my devices over a longer period. I&rsquo;ve accepted not having the latest and greatest and have upgraded only when there has been a compelling reason.</p>

<p>For interest&rsquo;s sake I maintain a spreadsheet to track how long I&rsquo;ve owned major technology assets, and compute &lsquo;life of service&rsquo; and &lsquo;cost per week&rsquo;. Two of our TVs, however, pre-date this spreadsheet, so they are definitely ready for replacement!</p>

<p>Some highlights from my spreadsheet include:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Device</th>
<th align="left">Service Life</th>
<th align="left">Weekly Cost</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">MacBook Pro</td>
<td align="left">5.8 years</td>
<td align="left">$5.71</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">QNAP NAS</td>
<td align="left">6.4 years</td>
<td align="left">$3.12</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">Cinema Display</td>
<td align="left">8.8 years</td>
<td align="left">$2.82</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left"><strong>Average</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></td>
<td align="left">3.6 years</td>
<td align="left">$4.50</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="it-all-comes-back-to-budgeting">It all comes back to budgeting</h2>

<p>Letting the equipment age was fine in itself. Now though, we have a backlog of technology all set for replacement at the same time. The problem is I haven&rsquo;t been reserving cash to replace the depreciated items. I responsibly saved up for the iMac, but other technology has not had a regular savings pattern applied to it.</p>

<p>Writing this post has prompted me to create a new line item for technology upgrades in my <a href="https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=omvgckrfFThsnI3X&amp;utm_source=customer_referral">YNAB</a> budget. I&rsquo;ve set a monthly savings goal. This way I&rsquo;ll be able to build my savings to facilitate a household technology refresh. I will keep ploughing money into this category on a monthly basis so that when the next device needs replacing, I&rsquo;ll have the money sitting there waiting to be used. That beats going into debt - and don&rsquo;t even get me started on the scourge of <a href="https://www.afterpay.com/en-AU">Afterpay</a>! That&rsquo;s a post for another day.</p>

<p>All in all I have a pretty great job. I&rsquo;ve been doing it for long enough that I feel I have well and truly mastered the fundamentals.</p>

<p>With my interest in personal productivity I have constructed a range of efficiencies into my process flow to make things easier for me. This  enables me to increase my overall productivity, do more with no more effort.</p>

<p>Despite all of this I am still working with people, and they can&rsquo;t be automated, and the margin for error is greater than that of machines and systems. As a result, sometimes I have days where I turn up for a scheduled meeting only to find out that they are no longer available or that there was a &lsquo;diary mix-up&rsquo;.</p>

<p>When this happens, I don&rsquo;t get upset. I see it as an opportunity to either recover some bonus free time, or it unlocks the ability to get ahead on some other piece of work.</p>

<p>I enjoy the responsibility of self-management like this. I think I would struggle having to return to a job that was micro-managed, or doing something that was a small cog in a larger wheel. I like owning the process soup to nuts, and making things work the way I think is best.</p>

<p>I am most comfortable within a nuclear family. I grew up in a family with my Mom and 3 siblings. We had a few extended family members, but most lived in different parts of the country or overseas.</p>

<p>As an adult the nuclear family is again the structure we are living in, except now <em>I&rsquo;m</em> the Dad. My two sisters live in the same city, while my brother has recently moved to Switzerland. There&rsquo;s no animosity between any of us, but we simply don&rsquo;t see each other that much.</p>

<p>My wife has some family on her side, and those are the people we see the most.</p>

<p>In reality, we live our life as a small nuclear family of four. This is generally fine, except for when we would like to have a grown-up night out, or have some respite from children. Without the babysitting potential that comes from an extended family, we have to go to the open market and find a babysitter. That added cost and inconvenience does mean that we don&rsquo;t get out as much as we might like.</p>

<p>While that&rsquo;s not ideal, I also know that we are creating a strong and safe environment for our kids. They don&rsquo;t have any fears of violence, abuse, drunkenness or any of the other things that occur behind closed doors that can lead to the destruction of a loving and peaceful childhood. That is a wonderful gift we are giving them, and I&rsquo;m sure, as adults, they will appreciate that more than not having enough uncles and aunties to visit.</p>

<p>Right now in Perth we are in the perfect time of the year to enjoy nature. We are moving into nice spring sunshine with temperatures in the mid-twenties. This is a time to enjoy, before the Perth furnace gets cranking for summertime and I can‚Äôt step outside without getting burnt. The grass is still green from winter, before it browns off over the summer months.</p>

<p>I visited <a href="https://www.visitperth.com.au/see-and-do/parks-gardens-and-reserves/Venues/queens-gardens">Queens Gardens</a> in East Perth. Nature was in full bloom. Multiple groups of ducklings were running after their mothers. A group of cygnets were sitting under the shade of a tree. The cygnets were a grey colour, before they grow their unique black feathers; black swans - a feature of Perth‚Äôs naturescape.</p>

<p>There is a downside to Perth nature, and that is the flies. A few years I have a recollection of our then State government cutting the amount of funding dedicated to <a href="https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/land-use/control-bush-flies-dung-beetles?page=0%2C0#smartpaging_toc_p0_s0_h2">fly management by dung beetles</a>. Over the last few years I am convinced that we have more bush flies than we used to. It‚Äôs frustrating, but if I want to take the good of nature I suppose I have to accept the bad.</p>

<p>You do get used to doing the what I know as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aussie_salute">Aussie wave</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past year I&rsquo;ve been enjoying food a bit <em>too</em> much. Concurrently I&rsquo;ve stopped playing sport. This has led to an imbalance in the food in/energy out equation.</p>

<p>In turn, I&rsquo;ve seen the growth of a generous belly for the first time in my life. I&rsquo;m not particularly pleased about this. My kid calling me &lsquo;fat Dad&rsquo;, is jesting that cuts a little too close to the bone!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to do a little more exercise but time is a constant challenge. Plus, if the exercise in question doesn&rsquo;t involve a ball, I have a hard time maintaining interest. While I&rsquo;ve done gym work plenty in the past, I&rsquo;ve never loved it and have a hard time sticking with it.</p>

<p>What I can do instantly is reduce the input side of the equation by changing (and reducing) what I eat. So I&rsquo;ve put myself on a diet. I&rsquo;ve turned to the service of <a href="https://www.liteneasy.com.au">Lite n&rsquo; Easy</a> to deliver portion controlled, dietician planned meals. The food is okay, albeit somewhat repetitive.</p>

<p>I miss the more flavoursome fattening food but hopefully the changed diet will pay off over the next few months. I reckon I need to lose about 10kg. That will get me back to what I consider my &lsquo;standard&rsquo; weight. I don&rsquo;t need to lose it all in the next month, but I need to lose it over this next year.</p>

<p>It seems that part of the human condition is to view failure as an end in and of itself. I think it‚Äôs better to consider it part of the process towards success.</p>

<p>A life well-lived encompasses a procession of trade-offs. We necessarily fail to do all the things we might want. We can‚Äôt be good at everything. We don‚Äôt have time to do everything. Are we failing because we don‚Äôt manage to do it all? Are we failing because we‚Äôre not multi-tasking our way to success?</p>

<p>That kind of thinking is probably a path to depression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúFailure is not an option.‚Äù
‚Äî <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_Is_Not_an_Option">A phrase credited to Gene Kranz and Apollo 13, but never said in reality</a> - probably because he knew failure is part of the equation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Failing is a trade-off. Failing is inevitable. It‚Äôs not possible to achieve the highest goals without accepting failure along the way. We shouldn‚Äôt beat ourselves up over our failures, because they are necessary to build success.</p>

<p>Time is limited. A failure to do something can represent a successful engagement with something else. I think I‚Äôm making the case for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Holland's_Opus">Mr. Holland‚Äôs Opus</a> approach to life, failure and success. Our greatest success might be hiding behind what was first thought a massive failure.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not a handyman. Never have been. When I was young, I would be roped into helping my stepdad do work around the house or on the car. I dutifully participated despite the boredom. I couldn‚Äôt find joy in repairs and construction.</p>

<p>As an adult my disinterest in physical work consolidated. Handyman tasks were a burden, made harder by the knowledge that my efforts would not match what could be achieved by paying a professional. I would rather throw money at the problem than attempt a DIY.</p>

<p>Now I‚Äôm a Dad and my son has to build a wooden <em>Kub Kar</em> as part of his Scouts program. At the briefing session I saw the thrill and excitement of other kids&hellip; and other Dads. Meanwhile, I felt dread. Here it was: a construction/woodworking project that I would have to motivate my kid to get involved in. While simultaneously trying to motivate myself.</p>

<figure>
<img src="uploads/2019/6188bbb1c0.jpg" />
<figcaption>This has to become a car.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In my boy I can see the same mindset I had as a child. He&rsquo;s not showing any desire to work with tools to build an impressive car. I imagine those other kids with their Dads, working away in the shed to build something great. Meanwhile, we&rsquo;re just trying to build something that will roll.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <em>trying</em> to be a good Dad. I&rsquo;m <em>trying</em> to show interest. I hope my son will <em>try</em> to get engaged in the project.</p>

<p>Without skill, effort is all we have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is psychological gravity, not technical inertia, however, that is the greater force against the open web. Human beings are social animals and centralized social media like Twitter and Facebook provide a powerful sense of¬†ambient humanity‚Äîthe feeling that ‚Äúothers are here‚Äù‚Äîthat is often missing when one writes on one‚Äôs own site.</p>

<p>I must rely on vague and fading recollections to remember anything of my life that happened more than a decade ago. Any key events forward from around 2003, I start to have digital records to draw upon as a memory trigger. For instance, I can say with absolute knowledge that on 17 June 2006, I was playing with our new puppy, Indi. I recall this evening, but only by accessing the metadata of the photos can I know when it actually happened. Earlier this year, Indi died. So much time has passed.</p>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2019/eb26005bd2.jpg" alt="Indi and I" title="Indi and I.jpg" border="0" width="599" height="399" /></p>

<p>With digital records now pervasive, recollection can be supported by hard data. No more complete reliance on a fuzzy memory.</p>

<p>I remember as a child playing at a friend&rsquo;s house; I remember it seeming absolutely enormous. We spent the day running through the garden, up and down the stairs inside and around the giant lounge room. I can visualise it clearly. But I can&rsquo;t say what year it was, where it was, or why I was there. My recollection of the scene is strong, but the situation is unknown. I don&rsquo;t have the option of reviewing a geotag to be able to revisit the location as an adult. It&rsquo;s a memory and nothing more.</p>

<p>My kids will experience a different world. All their life events have been captured, whether through photos, video, audio or journal entries written by their Dad. All those pieces of data have metadata. If they have a recollection in the future, it is likely they will be able to enter the date into their device of the time and bring up the evidence of the memory in glorious detail.</p>

<p>I wonder, though, if this will make their recollections richer, or whether the reality of the evidence at hand will diminish the richness of their mind&rsquo;s eye?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2019/10/22/in-the-blogging.html">mentioned previously</a> an idea to make November my own <em>Blogvember</em>.</p>

<p>From that idea, <a href="https://micro.blog/galexa">@galexa</a> <a href="https://micro.blog/galexa/6142069">asked if I would have a list of prompts</a>. I hadn&rsquo;t even considered that, but he makes a fair point. If I&rsquo;m using Inktober as my guide, it has prompts, so why not offer them for Blogvember as well?</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve put together the following list of prompts. Some will be easy, some might be personal, and some could prove controversial. Doesn&rsquo;t that sounds like a combination of the content you might want to find on a blog?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have both <a href="http://canion.micro.blog/2019/03/14/im-busy-isnt.html">written</a> about and <a href="http://canion.micro.blog/2019/03/11/the-modern-trap.html">noted</a> upon the false value of busyness within our societal norms.</p>

<p>One of my favourite independent writers, <a href="https://micro.blog/jamesshelley">James Shelley</a> has <a href="https://jamesshelley.com/2019/06/19/why-are-we-busy/">published an interesting take</a> on the same topic. He cites many references, including one of my favourites, Thorstein Veblen, he of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good"><em>Veblen Goods</em> economic paradox</a>.</p>

<p>James puts a focus on busyness as status symbol:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we need to appear busy because we all know that valuable people are busy people. When we tell others that we are working all the time we are ‚Äòimplicitly suggesting that we are sought after, which enhances our perceived status.‚Äô</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So claiming to &lsquo;be busy&rsquo; is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_signalling">virtue signalling</a> our perceived value to the world. It has little to do with the actual work, but the importance of the person to whom the work is attached.</p>

<p>In my articles, I determined that busyness is not a badge of honour, but should be seen as a cry for help. James arrives at a similar conclusion. He explains that busyness should be perceived as one being overcommitted, unclear or unable to prioritise and eliminate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The alternative to being busy is having clear priorities about what constitutes the highest value, triaged within strict parameters, and then defiantly walking away from everything else that falls below the threshold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not something to be celebrated, so let&rsquo;s not. We need to find a new definition of personal value. James has a good idea for this, but I&rsquo;m not going to spoil the surprise. <a href="https://jamesshelley.com/2019/06/19/why-are-we-busy/">Go read his article and find out what he suggests</a>!</p>

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2019/06/21/atlassian-declares-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-06-21 10:08:00 &#43;0800">Jun 21, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Atlassian is an interesting company that possibly doesn&rsquo;t get the kudos it might deserve. As an Australian, I have admiration for seeing one of <em>ours</em> hit it big internationally. Atlassian and Canva are probably the only two Australian companies that immediately spring to mind as having won big in the international IT space.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m impressed that Atlassian continue to walk the walk in regard to their <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/company/values">world-view and values</a>. This is evident in their now public approach to mergers and acquisitions. They are trying to reduce the angst and power imbalance and increase the fairness and focus on outcomes.</p>

<p>From their blog post announcing the release of a new <a href="https://editorial.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ED/pages/262284/The+Atlassian+Term+Sheet">public term sheet</a> to support merger and acquisition deals:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>one thing has become very clear to us about the M&amp;A process ‚Äì it‚Äôs outdated, inefficient, and unnecessarily combative, with too much time and energy spent negotiating deal terms and not enough on what matters most: building great products together and delivering more customer value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is plenty of ego in the IT world. The &lsquo;bro&rsquo; culture permeates, and it promotes ego and &lsquo;winning&rsquo;, rather than value creation and shared successes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an effort to reduce this unnecessary friction and increase trust, we‚Äôre doing something that, to our knowledge, no company has done before: we‚Äôve crafted a new M&amp;A term sheet and we‚Äôre making it public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much time is wasted through replicated effort. The software world is built on the reuse of frameworks. Not having to re-invent the wheel each time a new project begins is how great advancements are realised. What Atlassian are doing here is providing a fundamental public framework for mergers and acquisitions. Spend less time, money and effort doing things that have been done before and instead focus on getting the deal done and realising the value that prompted the M&amp;A in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that because of the leverage that many buyers exert over sellers, certain ‚Äúmarket‚Äù terms have evolved to buyers‚Äô advantage, even though, based on the data, it‚Äôs simply not necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example where pure <em>laissez-faire</em> markets are wonderful in theory and damaging in reality. Market power is a thing that is readily exerted. This creates a culture of &lsquo;winners&rsquo; and &lsquo;losers&rsquo; where the real focus should be on having the reason for coming together create a win for all. This doesn&rsquo;t need to be a zero-sum game.</p>

<p>I hope this new approach to M&amp;As catches on, and less money is spent on wasteful lawyer fees and negotiation and everybody can end up with a better outcome at the end of the process. The market will be better off, customers will benefit, and the stakeholders to the deal will both be better off with less of the angst, stress and ill-feeling that can arise at the end of a protracted M&amp;A process.</p>

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2856677032">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I read this because it seems one of those books that should be read before one dies. So it goes. The worldview (universe view?) of the Tralfamadorian&rsquo;s resonated with the reading I have done recently on stoicism. Perhaps that was always as it was meant to be?<br /><br />I am glad to have read this book. but will have to contemplate more on what it means for me, who is currently living in an existence in a different era.

         	<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything is 42.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ndash; Douglas Adams</p>

<p>In that case, I&rsquo;m looking forward to true enlightenment because today is my 42nd birthday.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to be born in Australia. We didn&rsquo;t have much growing up. Raised by a mother whose husband returned to the USA without his wife and four children, we benefited from the generosity of the country&rsquo;s social safety net to keep our heads just above water.</p>

<p>Life went on, I enjoyed my education and saw it as a pathway to something bigger. The nation helped me once again with its low-cost loan system to support students in the costs of attending university. Without the ability to defer these subsidised university fees until I was employed, I would not have gained a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Economics and Law.</p>

<p>At 22 I met my wife, Hannah, through a random chance encounter during a night out. We hit it off and things grew from there. As it turned out, my wife is the daughter of the man who at the time was Leader of the Federal Opposition party, and who had served with distinction as a Minister in the famous Hawke government.</p>

<p>The fact that I, a boy who grew up with not much, should be thrust into this very different world, is a measure of the egalitarian potential of our nation. It has led to a whole range of circumstances that seem unimaginable from my perspective of a boy from a low-income family.</p>

<p>In 2005 we married. Since then we have owned and operated a small business and had two wonderful children. Over the years we have had had medical emergencies and fun and sadness. We exist most happily when we have a project to focus upon.</p>

<p>I played basketball until I was 40, at which point my knees and hips said, &ldquo;enough&rdquo;, and I was forced to give up my favourite sport.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in computing and technology. This interest persists even as I&rsquo;m no longer the young whipper-snapper.</p>

<p>My hair is greying, my wrinkles are deepening, my belly is expanding. I am a family man who values his wife and children over and above his job, a career, or professional reputation.</p>

<p>I see the potential in Hannah to participate in the body politic of our nation. The country that held me close, lifted me up, and gave me the chance to build resilience in my youth and explore my potential in adulthood.</p>

<p>So here I sit in the foyer of middle age, full of interest for the future.</p>

<p>This is my 42.</p>

<blockquote>Since it began operations in 2010, Uber has grown to the point where it now collects over $45 billion in gross passenger revenue, and it has seized a major share of the urban car service market. But the widespread belief that it is a highly innovative and successful company has no basis in economic reality.
<p>

An examination of Uber‚Äôs economics suggests that it has no hope of ever earning sustainable urban car service profits in competitive markets. Its costs are simply much higher than the market is willing to pay, as its nine years of massive losses indicate.</blockquote>

<p><p>Enjoy the Uber ride while it lasts because at this rate the service won&rsquo;t be around in the future. Ultimately, the tune will stop playing on this game of musical chairs.</p>

<blockquote>Microsoft said it was removing periodic password changes from the security baseline settings it recommends for customers and auditors. After decades of Microsoft recommending passwords be changed regularly, Microsoft employee Aaron Margosis said the requirement is an ‚Äúancient and obsolete mitigation of very low value.‚Äù</blockquote>

<p>I use <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> to reduce my own security risk by allowing it to automatically generate random passwords as required, but I&rsquo;m not most people.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to see one of the industry giants admitting to the risks posed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater">security theatre</a> and changing its best-practice recommendations for password management.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It&rsquo;s not particularly easy getting into the swing of work after an extended absence. Today is my first day with my legs back under the desk after enjoying an extended break.</p>

<p>This is a time of reacquainting myself with things. Picking up projects and tasks that have laid idle for some time, waiting for my return. Checking in on others and hoping that progress has been made in my absence.</p>

<p>This first day back has not been <em>productive</em> in the sense that tangible and visible work has not been completed. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s given me a chance to refamiliarise myself with the job. I&rsquo;ve got some fresh perspectives on how I want to do the work, so I&rsquo;ve been able to think on how those might be incorporated.</p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve also had that lovely job of reading through hundreds of emails that have built up. Fortunately, with the help of <a href="https://sanebox.com/t/0fo5o6vsgt">Sanebox</a>, my inbox had been automatically sorted into groups ranging from &lsquo;totally useless&rsquo;, through &lsquo;probably not useful&rsquo; ending in &lsquo;aged, but still probably worth reading&rsquo;. This made me email triage job quick and easy. At the same time, I was able to unsubscribe from some mail that was clearly junk.</p>

<p>So, today is the day where my engine has been started, and left to idle gently while it warms up. Over the next couple of days, I would expect I might be able to get out of the driveway. We shall see.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if the software establishes itself as a consistent part of my blogging workflow. The big challenge is that there are <em>so many</em> great writing apps on macOS (and iOS), so competition is intense.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2019/03/14/im-busy-isnt.html">‚ÄòI‚Äôm Busy‚Äô Isn‚Äôt a Badge of Honour</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2019/03/14/im-busy-isnt.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-03-14 13:07:55 &#43;0800">Mar 14, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It‚Äôs common within Australian business culture for people, when asked the question of ‚ÄòHow are you going?‚Äô, to respond with something along the lines of, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm really busy‚Äô, or ‚Äòflat out‚Äô.</p>

<p>This might be a reflexive response to avoid having to provide a more substantive answer, or it may be bluster to hide the fact they are anything <em>but</em> busy. Mostly, I think the response is given in the belief that ‚Äúbusy-ness‚Äù implies importance, worth and value. I think this is misguided.</p>

<p>When I hear somebody say they are busy, I tend to interpret it as:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don‚Äôt know how to delegate, so I‚Äôm doing everything myself.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm disorganised and can‚Äôt structure my days.</li>
<li>I‚Äôve failed to prioritise and eliminate extraneous activity.</li>
<li>I‚Äôve actually got nothing to do, but I don‚Äôt want anybody to find out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Being busy is not a badge of honour. It‚Äôs a cry for help. Either you‚Äôve got too much going on, or not nearly enough. Either way, there‚Äôs going to be a lack of focus on the projects and activities that really matter, and deliver true value.</p>

<p>Customers don‚Äôt pay for busy-ness; they pay for value provided. A customer doesn‚Äôt care how much work went into something; they care if it solves their problem.</p>

<p>If you find yourself busy all the time, don‚Äôt accept it, and don‚Äôt feel good about it. Identify how to eliminate, automate or simplify the tasks that are eating away your days. Gain back some time that can be put to better use, such as long-term planning, blue-sky thinking, or relaxing by the pool.</p>

<p>People are not machines. Our lives should be balanced. Sacrificing some busy time for a chance to pursue enjoyment, self-development, or diversification is a trade worth making. If you‚Äôre not busy, these alternative activities will fill your time in productive ways and build knowledge and capability over time. If you‚Äôre too busy, rebalancing and jettisoning the things that don‚Äôt add value will help you to concentrate on the things that matter.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve got some annual leave time from work coming up. I&rsquo;m not going away on a holiday. It&rsquo;s going to be time spent at home supporting the family.</p>

<p>Despite there being a lack of travel and adventure tied to this leave, I still need to make sure I construct a plan for the time. I don&rsquo;t want to get to the end of it and be confronted with a return to work, only to realise I&rsquo;ve wasted my leave not doing much besides noodling around on the computer for no meaningful outcome.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2019/2/intentionality">recent post from David Sparks about Intentionality</a> aligns well with this thinking. I also like his idea of using a birthday as a personal annual review day. That&rsquo;s clever. With my birthday being smack-bang in the middle of the year, it also can work as a half-year review.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Roald Dahl‚Äôs books brought me hours of enjoyment when I was a child. There was little that could top the excitement of reading one of his books that would, of course, be illustrated by Quentin Blake. He created a world into which I could immerse myself, no matter how fantastical the setting might be.</p>

<p>Now, via <a href="https://kottke.org/19/01/a-writing-shed-of-ones-own">Jason Kottke</a>, I&rsquo;ve had an opportunity to see, in the video embedded below, the environment in which Dahl worked, and to him him speak of the mindset needed to create such amazing works of fiction.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQkz_X1Rg60" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>There are concepts arising in this video that have started to again be considered relevant in today‚Äôs modern world as being helpful in improving productivity and performance.</p>

<p>Highlights from this short clip include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The need to immerse himself, for around 4 to 5 hours per day, in the work, and be away from other things. This reflects perfectly the concept of 'deep work' as recently brought into public consciousness by <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport</a>. It takes time, focus and the avoidance of distraction to reach a zone of high productivity. This place is rare in the modern workplace. Making time for extended periods of focus can represent a huge competitive advantage over the competition.</li>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Our family recently travelled to Bali for a holiday break. It was a week of relaxation at the tail end of a year that has been pretty crazy, and a 2019 that we expect will be even more hectic.</p>

<p>When you travel with kids, conversations can move in varied and interesting directions. Our 7-year old boy took a particular interest in the toilets that were installed throughout the hotel we were staying. The brand ‚Äî <a href="https://www.toto.com/index.htm">TOTO</a> ‚Äî is one seen all over the world, but less so in Australia. He was enthralled by the features: from automatic flushing with infrared sensors, to in-built bidets. Even the design of the loos was novel to him. He was fascinated. Next he realised that TOTO had also been responsible for the all of the tapware as well. Incredible!</p>

<p>As a responsible Dad, I kept the toilet banter going, egging him on to explain to me further what he loved about them. I tried to add some interesting educational angles as well. I suggested that as a Japanese company, TOTO probably took great care in their manufacturing processes. I explained how Japan was the cradle of modern manufacturing methods, and how the Toyota Production System changed the world. I&rsquo;m not sure he bought into my lesson on lean thinking, though. I will have to try again in the future.</p>

<p>Over the length of our stay, our conversations escalated to the point where I suggested we contact TOTO directly to let them know what great work they were doing with their toilet design. He took to that idea! So we did it. My son wrote an email to TOTO Customer Service, noting how impressed he was with their toilets, and expressing his desire to have them installed in our house as well.</p>

<p>I figured that would be the end of it. I didn&rsquo;t expect to hear back, or if we did, I assumed it would be a boilerplate response. After a few days, we did in fact receive a reply, and it was a wonderful, personal email from TOTO‚Äôs Senior Manager of Customer Service. In the email, she expressed gratitude for my son&rsquo;s kind words, and also offered to send him some tokens of appreciation if we could provide our mailing details.</p>

<p>We replied, and for fun, included a photo of David and I enjoying ourselves in Bali.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1114" src="http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/cac9c9a6b5.jpg" width="480" height="639" /></p>

<p>A few more conversational emails bounced back and forth between TOTO and ourselves, and they asked if we could send a photo of David with his items once they arrived.</p>

<p>Within the next few week, we received an express mailed package from TOTO in Atlanta, to us in Perth, Australia. Just this concept alone was enough to blow my son‚Äôs mind. As promised, we sent another photo back with David holding onto the gifts he had been sent, and this was acknowledged by TOTO with thanks.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1115" src="http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/4d3957e2e0.jpg" width="960" height="1280" /></p>

<p>I see two key lessons in all of this:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Always embrace crazy conversations with your kids. They‚Äôre fun, and you never know where they might end up.
Genuine customer service ‚Äî not selling ‚Äî is the key to building great brand equity. I might never buy a TOTO toilet. My son might never buy a TOTO toilet. But I think both of us will be TOTO brand ambassadors from this point forward. Not because we were sent some trinkets, but because we had a genuine human interaction. We connected with a person who was obviously engaged enough in their own job to engage positively with us. If that employee is happy, then the company must have something going for it, and that‚Äôs the kind of company I want to see succeed.</li>
    <li>From a business perspective, customer service shouldn‚Äôt be about hitting sales targets or avoiding bad press. It should be about working to have people care about your brand.</li>
</ol>

<p>So thanks TOTO, for bringing fun and joy to me and my son‚Äôs lives, and for making sure this particular Bali holiday will have a very strange and unique anchor memory.</p>

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2018/08/20/personal-finance-should.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-08-20 10:12:40 &#43;0800">Aug 20, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I believe personal finance should be a core subject taught to our children at school. We should teach how to manage and budget money, the concepts of savings and compound interest, and the risks of credit and deferred payment. Finance and money management education should be threaded through each year of schooling. I think it would offer more practical value - and a better return on investment - than some of the traditional subjects taught.</p>

<p>An opinion piece in <em>The Age</em> by Liora Miller, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/is-paypass-the-enemy-of-the-young-20180818-p4zyaz.html">‚ÄúIs PayPass the enemy of the young?‚Äù</a> reflects on some of the risks of tap and go payments, especially for young people.</p>

<blockquote>
  Australian Tax Office research this year reveals that only one in five Australians still prefer using cash for purchases.
</blockquote>

<p>Last week I bought lunch from a sandwich shop. I paid with cash. The look of surprise on the server‚Äôs face was clear; to the point where we both made a joke about the rarity of somebody paying with ‚Äòreal money‚Äô as opposed to PayPass tap and go. In Australia, tap and go is essentially the default.</p>

<blockquote>
  Cash use in Australia has fallen by a third in a period of six years.
</blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs about how long tap and go transactions have been available, and I would think the next third of cash usage will decline more rapidly than another six years.</p>

<p>When I use tap and go, I take the extra step of entering the transaction into <a href="https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=omvgckrfFThsnI3X&amp;utm_source=customer_referral">YNAB</a> on my phone. YNAB‚Äôs direct bank import features don‚Äôt work with Australian banks but I consider that a feature because entering each transaction keeps me connected to my money and my budget. I recognise, however, that I‚Äôm an outlier. Most people are not taking a similar extra step - it‚Äôs spend and forget.</p>

<blockquote>
  A cashless society in the near future appears to be an inevitability. We need to focus on ensuring young people understand the implications of deferred payment.
</blockquote>

<p>This is the key point of the article, but unfortunately, Miller fails to suggest how this might happen. This brings us back to my initial premise: that we as a society need to <em>get serious</em> about financial literacy.</p>

<p>I am Treasurer and Director of <a href="http://www.midlas.org.au/">Midlas</a>, a not-for-profit organisation that offers financial counselling as one of its key community support services. The government provides funding support to enable Midlas to offer this service. Yet demand is outpacing supply, and this is a common refrain across all the providers of financial counselling.</p>

<p>As great as it is that government provides financial support to assist organisations such as Midlas help people in financial stress, the policy settings are wrong. Just like medicine, where spending on prevention is cheaper and more effective than spending on a cure, spending on financial education would be more effective and deliver greater good than spending on help after the damage is done. Avoiding financial stress would lessen the prevalence of issues that often stem from financial stress, such as illness and poor mental health, relationship damage, homelessness, and drug and alcohol abuse. Not only would this benefit the individual but it would help broader society who share the negative impact of these societal problems.</p>

<p>Through us, the government needs to get serious about teaching our kids about personal finance and money management. The growth of tap and go is a lead indicator of a problem that may come to bite us in years to come. We should act before personal indebtedness becomes a national plague.</p>

<p>It was <a href="https://jalopnik.com/tesla-switching-to-24-7-shifts-to-push-for-6-000-model-1825335216">recently reported</a> and <a href="http://cdevroe.com/2018/04/19/elon-musk-on-meetings/">brought to my attention</a> that Elon Musk had issued a memo to the staff of Tesla. I‚Äôm no Musk acolyte, but within his commentary there can be found some good stuff. Within this particular memo Musk highlighted a number of productivity boosting tips. One tip jumped out at me because it is aligned with how I explain to my customers the way I aim to deliver the <a href="http://andrewcanion.com/work/" title="Andrew‚Äôs work">Business Evaluation</a> service of the <a href="https://www.business.gov.au/assistance/entrepreneurs-programme/business-evaluation" title="Business Evaluation service">Entrepreneurs‚Äô Programme</a>. This is fundamental to how I work to be respectful of their time commitment.</p>

<p>Elon Musk was reported as writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Please get rid of all large meetings, unless you‚Äôre certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short.
</blockquote>

<p>The aim of my engagement with my customers is not to prove myself, or the worth of the service, by hanging around for hours and hours on end. If something can be achieved in two hours rather than four, then it‚Äôs bad business to take the four hours. If the work needs four hours, then I will commit that time. I won‚Äôt commit six.</p>

<p>What I say to my customers is that I want to stay with them for as long as I am delivering genuine value that is over and above the time, effort and person-hours they are committing to the process. Once I see the value they are receiving is tapering off, then I will wrap things up. The last thing I want to do is overstay my welcome, using up their time when they could be doing something else that could contribute more to their business success.</p>

<p>Just as Musk implored his staff to keep meetings short, so I remind and encourage myself to only use as much time is necessary ‚Äì and no more.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I lean heavily on my diary to plan ahead, guide me through my days, and establish a rhythm to my life. The type of work I do has a tendency to drift towards haphazard if not controlled, so a calendar helps me establish and maintain order.</p>

<p>The problem I‚Äôve faced in more recent times is having an overabundance of calendars I need to refer to before being able to commit to something. In simpler times, if I had a gap between 9am and 5pm, it was available to be taken up by a meeting. With the added complexity of kids and a wife who has an even more complex and random schedule than my own, things have reached a point where I need to check about 5 different calendars before I could confirm if I <em>actually</em> had availability for a meeting, irrespective of whether there was a gap in <em>my</em> calendar.</p>

<p>This year I made a personal pact to get better at managing this uncertainty. I‚Äôve considered how I could build a system that works better for me and my family, while maintaining flexibility for my clients. Many of the methods I‚Äôve adopted are not new ideas; in fact, some are a blast to the past when people used paper day-runners and had a personal assistant (secretary?) who would prepare things on their behalf. Alas, I have neither of those, so I have leveraged my skills in process design and automation.</p>

<p>Following is an outline of my diary management workflow as it has developed to date. It remains a work in progress and I expect it will continue to change.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>I started by establishing clear and non-negotiable days for which I was available for visiting and meeting with clients. I refer to these as ‚ÄúExternal‚Äù days. The remaining days were locked in as days to spent at the office - my ‚ÄúInternal‚Äù days. These days are consistent every week, to help with that rhythm.</p>

<p>When visiting clients a lot of time is lost in transit. By collating these visits into a fewer number of days, I reduce my transit downtime, and have the opportunity to fill those days more effectively.</p>

<p>My ‚ÄúInternal‚Äù days facilitate getting into a <a href="http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2018/06/in-flow/">flow</a> state more often because they aren‚Äôt broken up by meetings and appointments. Again, a more productive outcome.</p>

<p>For calendaring, I rely on <a href="https://www.busymac.com/busycal/index.html">BusyCal</a> on the Mac and <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone">Fantastical</a> on iOS.</p>

<h2>Technology - WhenWorks</h2>

<p>My next area of improvement was in the way I was booking the meetings with clients on my ‚ÄúExternal‚Äù days. I had been spending too much time and effort bouncing emails back and forth, doing the ‚Äòavailability exchange‚Äô - trying to find a time that works for me and them. I needed to find a better way that was efficient but respected the impact of items on my other calendars.</p>

<p>I started with a trial of <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a>. This cloud-based service provides a method for people to book a meeting time that is subject to the parameters I set. Calendly was good, but had its drawbacks. I use FastMail for email/calendars/contacts and it uses standards-compliant IMAP/CalDAV/CardDAV protocols. Unfortunately, Calendly wants to only work well with Office 365/GSuite/iCloud. My employer provides me with an Office 365 account so I could still make use of the service, but it meant that I had to remember to replicate my Fastmail calendars to Office 365. It worked, but it never felt simple and seamless.</p>

<p>Enter, <a href="https://when.works">WhenWorks</a>. After trialling this for just a couple of weeks, I have purchased an annual subscription. WhenWorks is fundamentally an iOS app that is supported by a cloud-based booking platform. By running on my device it improves on  Calendly because it can access all my calendars, irrespective of what platform they reside upon. WhenWorks can take into consideration the impact of every single calendar when making times available for others to book.</p>

<p>WhenWorks is simply brilliant. It looks great and offers a full range of options without being overwhelming. Most importantly, my clients have used it without any problems whatsoever.</p>

<h2>Automation - TextExpander</h2>

<p>For the first half of this year I have been using saved email templates in <a href="https://cloze.com/">Cloze</a> to correspond with clients and ask them to select a meeting time using my Calendly service.</p>

<p>Now with my change to WhenWorks, I‚Äôm moving away from Cloze and back to using <a href="https://textexpander.com/">TextExpander</a> to send email using Mail.app instead. With TextExpander I can make a few choices upon snippet execution that lets me customise a boilerplate email. This way the email the client receives is quickly and efficiently tailored to the type of meeting we will have, and will prompt them to schedule a meeting using the appropriate WhenWorks meeting template relevant to that meeting type.</p>

<p>Credit to <a href="https://macsparky.com/">David Sparks</a> for providing <a href="https://youtu.be/z6nfiKOddsI">some of the tools</a> that helped me get this up and running quickly and easily.</p>

<h2>Routine &amp; Preparation - OmniFocus &amp; Daily Papers</h2>

<p>The last step is incredibly low-tech, but has made a profound difference to my state of mind at the beginning of each day. It is not a new approach. It is common sense. It is simple. But it requires discipline.</p>

<p>I have set a daily repeating task in <a href="https://omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> that commences at 4pm and is due at 5pm, prompting me to prepare for my next day‚Äôs meetings. That‚Äôs it; a simple prompt.</p>

<p>This prompt, however, ensures I remember to gather the various documents, information and whatever else I need to have ready to be successful for the events of the next day. Sometimes this process takes 2 minutes, sometimes the full hour.</p>

<p>Since doing this, I‚Äôve found I don‚Äôt have stress the next morning, suddenly realising that I‚Äôve got a meeting first thing that I have not prepared for. It creates a calm state of mind for the evening, knowing that I‚Äôm ready for the next day. It enables my mind to cogitate on what I have coming up, such that when events unfold I find myself better prepared and ready to roll than I otherwise would have been.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Each of these elements is fairly straightforward in and of themselves. Bringing them all together, though, has improved my flow, and has largely resolved the problem of double-booking and calendar mixups.</p>

<p>Of course this stuff is never done, and it will change with workload and circumstance. For now, however, I feel like it has gotten me closer to the concept of ‚Äò<a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/newsletters/archive/0909.html">mind like water</a>‚Äô than I was previously.</p>

  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs very easy to spend time focusing on work. It has a tangible reward - income! It provides an emotional response - we might love it or hate it (or even just feel meh about it). And, for many, it defines who we are.<sup id="fnref-835-1"><a href="#fn-835-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I‚Äôve been taking stock, and have realised that I need to add some more variety to my days. I do my work, I look after my kids, and despite us sometimes being ships passing in the night, I share time with my wife. What has gone missing though, is a third interest. What else can I do? How else can I bring some interest, variety and further meaning to my life?</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want to be passing time here on our earth, responsibly moving projects and tasks forward without having some fun and spontaneity along the way.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs clear what my answer must be - I need to find some hobbies!</p>

<p>Ideally, these hobbies will stretch me out of my comfort zone. While I have always been enjoyed technology and basketball, I should move outside these domains to see if I can find something else that is fun and different.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve drafted a list of ideas, with ideas ranging from board games to cooking. I plan on experimenting across a range of areas to see if anything grabs me. And because you can‚Äôt manage what you don‚Äôt measure, I will try to keep a journal in Day One to track any major hobby events and record my thoughts and impressions of things I try.</p>

<p>I hope I find a new and interesting activity to engage with, but even if I don‚Äôt, it will be an interesting life experiment.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn-835-1">
This concept of work defining who we are is particularly weird. The work we produce is a product, not a state of being. By defining ourselves by our work we are limiting our potential. The work we do should be a combined result of our skills, traits and personality. The work is <em>achieved</em> because of who we are; it is not <em>who</em> we are.

         	<p>Some days the work just flows. Tasks feels easy, decisions are made, words transfer from the brain to the keyboard with nary a pause; and engaging with people makes you realise the world is full of interesting characters.</p>

<p>These days of flow are generally few and far between. We structure our days such that we have no breathing room. Alternatively, we don‚Äôt structure anything and drift through without a clear and achievable goal in mind. If we can happen to find the Goldilocks Zone between those two extremes, and establish a mindset that is engaged yet relaxed, well, I think that‚Äôs where the magic happens.</p>

<p>Most days, of course, the work <em>doesn‚Äôt</em> flow. Things are a grind and stuff fails to work out as intended.</p>

<p>So the days where flow occurs; embrace it, because there‚Äôs no guarantee it will be back tomorrow. Get the most out of this rare and elusive asset!</p>

<p>James Shelley:</p>

<blockquote>
  "When Riley posts something on Facebook, there is almost always feedback. Riley‚Äôs friends often click an innocuous-looking ‚Äòlike‚Äô button that serves as a low-cost, high-value social signal that reinforces Riley‚Äôs use of the platform. By contrast, Riley has no guarantee that sharing their thoughts on a personal blog would reach much of an audience at all."
</blockquote>

<p>This quote encapsulates the problem that the Indie-web movement has yet to fully resolve. While micro.blog is a great step in the right direction, it still doesn&rsquo;t provide that immediacy of connection - and that endorphin hit of a &lsquo;like&rsquo; or a &lsquo;retweet&rsquo; that social media is able to provide.</p>

<p>I encourage you to read the rest of the article; it is well-written and effectively articulates the challenge.</p>

<p>It was an absolute honour to attend the official swearing in ceremony of my father-in-law, The Hon Kim Beazley AC, as the 33rd Governor of Western Australia. The night featured great speeches, a military parade and a reception event. An unimaginable, once-in-a-lifetime experience for me and I have no doubt that Governor Beazley will excel in the role.</p>

         	<p>I joined both Facebook and Twitter many years ago, when they were technical ideas, as opposed to advertising machines driven by algorithms.</p>

<p>Part of the reason for joining in the first place was for me to reserve my namespace. Just like gold rushes of old, it‚Äôs always important to claim your username before somebody else jumps in before you and puts their stake in the ground. While Twitter and Facebook took off, I also had my namespaces at long-forgotten sites like Pownce, Myspace and Technorati.</p>

<h2>The Halcyon Days</h2>

<p>Over the following years, my engagement with Twitter and Facebook increased. Facebook was great for retaining connections with people I knew <em>IRL</em> while on Twitter I built a list of followers that I didn‚Äôt know, but whose insights and commentary I enjoyed. This ultimately revolved around my two greatest hobbies: basketball and the Apple IT ecosystem. From around 2011-2015 really were the salad days of these two services.</p>

<p>The problem for them (not me), however, was that I wasn‚Äôt paying the bills. Nor were any of the other users. We know how this story goes. As per the trope, if you‚Äôre not the customer, you‚Äôre the product. There was a realisation that I was certainly the product - being sold as advertising fodder by these services that needed revenue to keep the lights on, and investors invested.<sup id="fnref-613-1"><a href="#fn-613-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2>Addiction</h2>

<p>Over time, these services added dopamine to my day. The nefarious social engineering tweaks they built to maintain my engagement were difficult to defeat. Likes, comments, shares, retweets. All these things built in a way that tries to make you feel like you are valued by your audience, but which are all just further measures to build an advertising profile of each of their human products. But it kept me coming back.</p>

<p>My usage continued to grow until a series of events made me question what the hell I was doing. Firstly, most of the Facebook people I realised I either saw in real life ‚Äî which was much more satisfying ‚Äî or I never saw them, and didn‚Äôt have space in my life to genuinely care about them. The algorithm would occasionally surface them to my feed, then they would bubble down again to be forgotten. On Twitter, there was growing awareness (and evidence) of the hate, vitriol, bile and mistreatment of people, both inside and outside my personal feed.</p>

<h2>Downfall</h2>

<p>As the services became politicised, they became weaponised. Intolerance grew, they became echo chambers, and the value of what was being expressed was minimised. From link bait to listicles and lame videos, both services were serving up nothing but empty calories. I realised that I was using my most valuable resource ‚Äî my time ‚Äî on two services that were giving me nothing back in return for my investment.</p>

<p>Hence, the decision to withdraw my namespace claims. I have deactivated Facebook. I have deleted Twitter.</p>

<h2>Reversion</h2>

<p>What is great is that I don‚Äôt feel I have lost anything. I feel just as informed, and I actually feel calmer. I don‚Äôt have this buzz in the back of my brain, like an itch I can‚Äôt scratch, knowing that I need to check my feeds. It has freed up the time to do more productive things. I‚Äôve been reading actual books again. I have watched TV shows and movies with full focus.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been great to have more free time to invest in activities that provide mental nourishment, rather than the fast food diet I had become used to with social media. Ironically, I think I had it more right 10 years ago, before the age of social media, where this is exactly what I would do. I would read, learn, converse. I didn‚Äôt like, share and tweet. But I think, on balance, I was all the better for it. I‚Äôm enjoying this rebalancing I‚Äôm going through now, and I hope that it continues.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A few months ago I stopped using Facebook. I deactivated my account, deleted the Facebook apps from my iOS devices, and went cold-turkey. I have subsequently had to reactivate my account because of the need to engage with some groups that exist only on Facebook, but I continue to ignore my timeline.</p>

<p>It has been a great change for the better. Facebook adds a huge weight of nothing. It‚Äôs empty calories. It uses up time that could be better spent elsewhere. I haven‚Äôt missed any news; I don‚Äôt feel less engaged with the world. To the contrary, actually. I feel more engaged. I don‚Äôt crave the little dopamine hits of likes and comments. I‚Äôm still writing and recording aspects of my life, but now they are feeding content that I own, whether it‚Äôs on my own <a href="https://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/category/microblog/">microblog</a>, or in my <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> journal, or (heaven forbid) through one-on-one conversations.</p>

<p>It surprised me just how easily I was able to ‚Äòkick the habit‚Äô of using Facebook. I thought I would miss it. As if to emphasise just how hollow the platform is, I‚Äôve not had any of my myriad followers reach out to check if I‚Äôm still alive since my departure! That point highlights the disconnected connectedness Facebook promotes. Sure, you ‚Äòlike‚Äô somebody‚Äôs post, but do you remember it 30 seconds later? Would you notice if it were not there? The evidence would suggest not, and that spot in the timeline would just be filled by something else.</p>

<p>If I could dump the Facebook platform entirely I would. As it is, I will use it as little as possible, and only as required for specific functional tasks. I am not willing to gift my attention to Facebook, for it to leverage into profit. My hours on this planet are too valuable to give you them for free.</p>

         	<p>I bought <em>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</em> last night on a recommendation from a friend. I‚Äôm not a gamer, and I know this is an old game. I also know my late 2013 MacBook Pro is not built for gaming, but it was just able to render the graphics usefully (medium settings, lower res). The game was so fun! I‚Äôm not a highly skilled player, but it has me wanting more. It has been years since I really got into a computer game; <em>StarCraft</em> was probably the game I recollect as the last one I played to death, and that was about 20 years ago.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>If I have the option to communicate through text or voice, I‚Äôm choosing text every time.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt love writing; it‚Äôs not a passion. I‚Äôm more happy working with numbers, to be honest. What I am definitely not, though, is a talker.</p>

<p>In writing, I feel that I can more eloquently express my views. In conversation I never quite feel as agile, by comparison. It takes a lot of focus to think on my feet and maintain the flow. Add to that, the little voice in my head that is always there in the background, questioning whether the person I‚Äôm talking to is listening, if they care at all, or are they bored out of their brain. Talking comes with pressure!</p>

<p>When I write, however, it comes out much more formally than when I speak. I struggle to achieve a relaxed tone in my writing (as this article may attest!). I also have no indication as to whether my words have ever been read ‚Äî conversations don‚Äôt have that issue.</p>

<p>Ironically, so much of my work relies directly on my ability to have conversations with clients. There is a discerning factor, though. In these instances, I prefer to consider myself an empathic listener and interpreter. The more I listen, the more I can understand. If I‚Äôm talking, I‚Äôm not getting to the root of the issues and concerns of the firms I am trying to help. Sure, I will add some value through some suggestions, ideas and stories, but that tends to come more easily.</p>

<p>Then I go away and <em>write</em> some outcomes and actions!</p>

<h2>Podcasting</h2>

<p>Podcasting has definitely gone mainstream now. There is nothing in technology more reliant on voice and speaking than podcasting. Blogging I‚Äôm comfortable with - it‚Äôs writing. Podcasting? I have been a happy listener for years, but have never been a producer.</p>

<p>A new version of the app <a href="https://anchor.fm/">Anchor</a> has been released for iOS and Android. The app has had a pivot with its focus now being the generation of short, simple podcasts. I‚Äôve downloaded it, but haven‚Äôt yet had a play. I will probably try recording a few podcasts, but I have strong doubts that any of my efforts would be any good.</p>

<p>I really don‚Äôt like the sound of my own voice. I feel bad for people who have to listen to it normally, so to record myself and have to listen to my own voice in an extended recording is confronting in the extreme. I‚Äôm also not sure that I could maintain a coherent and interesting structure while speaking. Writing is different. You can plan, outline, edit, rewrite. Voice recording requires a lot more editing effort to achieve the same, and I‚Äôm no audio engineer.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt own any professional podcasting equipment. I don‚Äôt have a good mic. If I started a podcast it would be rudimentary at best. Then again, that makes me sound like the target market for Anchor.</p>

<p>Finally, but probably foremost, there is the issue of content. What to talk about? What to say? Why would anybody bother to listen?<sup id="fnref-525-1"><a href="#fn-525-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So I may, or may not, trial a podcast. I might record it, hate the result and delete it. Or it may turn out okay and I might share it to my blog. Who knows? I don‚Äôt know!</p>

I was a customer of Feedwrangler for a couple of years, and for the past year or so I‚Äôve used Feedly. Now I‚Äôm trialling Inoreader, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd actually use the features of their paid account. Feedbin is too expensive for me, due to currency conversion.</p>

<p>I wonder if the micro.blog community have thoughts on what is the best service?</p>

<p>I‚Äôm grandfathered into a Feedly account that supports more than 100 feeds at no charge, but I‚Äôm willing to pay if it means I get a better service as a result. Is there anything out there that is genuinely better than a free, unlimited subscriptions Feedly account?</p>

         	<p>I am always searching for the perfect notes app, and the best way to integrate that into my workflow. I‚Äôm not sure I have found the former and I haven‚Äôt achieved the latter, but I keep trying. It‚Äôs ultimately a Sisyphean task, because there‚Äôs always another note taking app just around the corner which will constitute a new way of working with it. Nevertheless, I try.</p>

<p>With our proliferation of devices it‚Äôs no longer enough to have a decent desktop-based notetaking process. Access needs to be ubiquitous, and that means cloud sync. While a few years ago that would limit the candidates significantly, nowadays sync is the price of entry. When the iPhone arose and syncing was hard, the best option was <a href="http://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a>. This app used its own sync engine to provide lightning fast sync. I had a large number of notes in Simplenote, but it was convoluted getting them on my Mac, which required Dropbox and <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">NVAlt</a> - an app which I love the concept of but it never really grew on me.</p>

<p>Nowadays there are an abundance of options, such as Apple Notes, OneNote, Notability, OmniOutliner, and the list goes on. The problem with this is fragmentation. Taking notes is one thing, finding them again later is quite another.  If I don‚Äôt have all my notes in one location, they may as well be lost. Plus that location needs to be available wherever I am and whatever device I have to hand. Spotlight search is useful, but I want to know where that note is, and I don‚Äôt want to have to trawl through search results to find it.</p>

<p>For the moment I have settled on <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear</a> for notes. It syncs reliably across iOS and macOS, it supports Markdown syntax and can export into a variety of formats. It also looks really pretty.</p>

<p>Despite my use of Bear, I haven‚Äôt totally solved the fragmentation problem. I continue to use <a href="http://www.goodnotesapp.com/">Goodnotes</a> for handwritten notes taken with my Apple Pencil, <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/devonthink-pro.html">DEVONThink Pro</a> for reference material, and <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a> for long-form writing. So stuff remains scattered.</p>

<p>And so my stone rolls back down the hill&hellip;</p>

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a fairly expensive proposition for something that won‚Äôt actively generate me money. <a href="http://Hubspot.com">HubSpot CRM</a> is free, but the product itself seems pretty average. You get what you pay for, I suppose.</p>

<p>When I start looking around the web for software, I also get a bit disappointed that I chose to go with <a href="https://fastmail.com">Fastmail</a> for my email service. While all these CRM services have native integrations for GSuite and O365, poor standards-compliant Fastmail gets left behind. I‚Äôve been able to get IMAP email to work, but not contacts and calendars.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Life can get overwhelming. Work to do, dinners to cook, kids to care for, relationships to tend. Trying to do it all can be fatiguing. I have found this to be particularly true over this current long school holiday break, where the presence of children and their needs are incessant, but the other parts of life still need to be managed.</p>

<p>Trying to balance it all is not easy, and I don‚Äôt believe there is any magic bullet that will solve it all. There are only ever going to be 24 hours in a day. So I think the best response to the pressure comes down to 3 main things<sup id="fnref-429-1"><a href="#fn-429-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Scheduling: maximising the efficient use of time.</li>
<li>Accepting: there‚Äôs no such thing as perfection.</li>
<li>Breathing: maintaining mental health through awareness of the bigger picture.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Scheduling</h2>

<p>Planning and scheduling can ease the mental burden. By making an agreement with yourself to do certain things at specified times there is clear evidence that time is being utilised to effect and things are getting done. At these times there is no need to worry about all the other things that aren‚Äôt getting done in the moment because at least you are doing something.</p>

<p>Personally this year I am trying to improve the structure of my scheduling. I am establishing days as either <em>internal</em> or <em>external</em>. Internal days are dedicated to working on the tasks I have recorded in OmniFocus, following the general <em>Getting Things Done</em> approach to task management. I will also use this time for internal meetings, planning and the like. External days will be available for me to get out on the road, visiting clients, following up business development opportunities, and networking.</p>

<p>I have taken my management of External days one step further by setting up a <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a> account. This service allows me to permit clients to book meetings with me directly, subject to my availability. Calendly knows the days I have set as External, and it knows when the slots I have made available are taken up, preventing them from being double-booked. Much time and effort was wasted last year mucking about with the to and fro of trying to coordinate meeting dates, so I hope this more automated approach will ease the burden.</p>

<h2>Accepting</h2>

<p>I am the type of person that wants everything to go just as according to plan. Of course, no plan survives first contact with the enemy. I have to accept the foibles of humanity and roll with the punches when things don‚Äôt go the way I wanted.</p>

<p>This is why planning methodology has moved away from ‚Äòwaterfall‚Äô to ‚Äòagile‚Äô ‚Äî because nothing works as intended, so change the plan rather than pretending that perfection is about to occur.</p>

<h2>Breathing</h2>

<p>In the chase for productivity at the micro-level, it is easy to lose context. Really, in the grand scheme of things, it‚Äôs highly likely that none of what we are doing actually matters that much. Now, this is not me promoting nihilism, because what we do does matter to those in our circles. What I am saying is that there are going to be few times where there is not sufficient slack in the timeline to pause; to take a time-out. In this moment, <em>breathe</em>.</p>

<p>Go outside, take a walk, talk to a friend, pray, meditate ‚Äî just do something different and unrelated to the task. Taking a break will freshen the mind and offer an opportunity to perceive that larger context. The thing that was causing stress may suddenly not seem quite so significant afterwards.</p>

<p>Ultimately, having a sound and stable mind will allow a focus on scheduling and facilitate acceptance of what can and cannot be achieved. It‚Äôs a virtuous circle.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>For months my home WiFi has been less than satisfactory. Dropouts, slow connections, complete failures to connect, router reboots required, and so on.</p>

<p>I have a slightly more complicated than average setup but it‚Äôs nothing so extreme that I should have had such annoying problems. I don‚Äôt live in an area with a lot of competition for WiFi spectrum and my hardware is all of the non-cheap variety.</p>

<p>I have tried different configurations from using my ISP provided <a href="https://www.dlink.com.au/home-solutions/DVA-2800-Talkbox-wireless-ac1600-dual-band-gigabit-adsl2-vdsl-modem-router-with-voip">D-Link DVA-2800</a> (the worst modem/router I have used in my life) as a single WiFi router, then in conjunction with the device I have used constantly for a number of years ‚Äî my Airport Extreme ac (the tower one). I have variously extended this with an Ethernet backhaul to a second, older Apple Time Capsule (the one that looks like a Mac Mini) and I have tried an approach where the D-Link has operated in bridge mode with the Airports acting as the router.</p>

<p>No approach has been that great, and none have solved the problems I outlined earlier.</p>

<h2>My pain points</h2>

<p>The constant problems I faced with all of these different approaches were:</p>

<ul>
<li>poor coverage, with 5GHz only working within a small radius, and failing coverage entirely at the extremities of my house and garden.</li>
<li>failure of devices to roam across two routers with the same SSID. This is a known problem with consumer grade WiFi that doesn‚Äôt offer intelligent roaming. My devices would hang on to a weak signal from one access point as opposed to switching over to a closer, stronger point. This problem was especially noticeable with MacBooks.</li>
<li>slow initial connections (again mainly with MacBooks) as they searched and connected to the best available signal. I have a feeling there is a software bug in there somewhere as well, because toggling WiFi off/on on the laptops would often then result in a speedy connection.</li>
<li>general frustrations with setting up. The D-Link interface is an abomination. The Airport software is much better, but it always seemed to take a bunch of clicks to get anywhere, and as with a lot of Apple stuff, it was short on diagnostics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given all these problems, I decided it was time for a change. Many of the podcasts I listen to feature ads for the Eero mesh WiFi product. This advertising is useless to me as far as selling me their product because they don&rsquo;t retail in Australia. It did, however, get me interested in the idea of a mesh network, and helped push me into the arms of Eero‚Äôs competitor<sup id="fnref-407-1"><a href="#fn-407-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In Australia, the best option seemed to be the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_wifi">Google Wifi</a> 3-pack. I pulled out my wallet and bought a pack for AU$399. Not cheap but my hope was that lowering my blood pressure with less frustration made it a good investment.</p>

<h2>Setting it up</h2>

<p>In my case, the setup was not quite as simple as Google makes it out to be. This may be my own fault, because I probably overthink things, to be honest. I knew I still needed a router to transfer my NBN Fibre-to-the-Node (and then copper to the house) connection. This meant I had to keep my horrible D-Link to act as the modem. With my Apple Airport, I had the D-Link set to bridge mode and the Airport took on the task of the primary router and DHCP server. This obviated the need to ever deal with the D-Link software.</p>

<p>I went with this same setup with Google Wifi, but no success. It couldn‚Äôt establish a connection to my ISP through DHCP, as required.</p>

<p>To resolve this problem, I had to go back to my D-Link and take it out of bridge mode. I had to have it act as both a modem and a router (but disable its WiFi) and have it farm an IP address to the primary Google Wifi point. This is frustrating because it creates a ‚Äúdouble-NAT‚Äù situation that seems unavoidable. Two devices, both creating a pool of IP addresses. The Airport wins here, as it was able to manage the DHCP connection with my ISP just fine.</p>

<h2>Up and running</h2>

<p>So now with this configuration my D-Link establishes the Internet connection while Google Wifi manages the internal WiFi and ethernet network. From this point it was smooth sailing. The Google Wifi app is quite good, apart from feeling very out of place on iOS due to its Android Material design aesthetic. It‚Äôs also weird to have to rely on a mobile app with no way of accessing the Wifi units through a computer. Finally, no iPad app - just a scaled iPhone app. Come on, Google, you can do better than that. While the Airport Utility looked prettier, Google Wifi gave me more control.</p>

<p>The network quality that Google Wifi delivers is excellent. I‚Äôve been able to use ethernet to create a wired backhaul to the second device that sits near our TV, and I have some strategically placed switches to extend my ethernet network for fixed devices. That each Google point only has a single ethernet jack is a little disappointing, but not really surprising given the typical home market it is aiming at. I have the third device in my bedroom. This one is not using Ethernet backhaul, but leverages the ‚Äòmesh‚Äô approach that is the whole point of the system anyway.</p>

<p>Since installation the WiFi throughout (and outside) the house has been fast and flawless. I am mostly able to connect to a 5GHz ac signal and roaming happens silently and easily. I don‚Äôt notice connections slowing down or failing. Whenever and wherever I open a MacBook it establishes an instant connection, whereas it used to take ages and would still sometimes fail.</p>

<h2>Netspot results</h2>

<p>A Netspot signal-to-noise quality comparison may indicate I haven‚Äôt experienced much change in overall signal quality with the change to Google Wifi, other than the Google Wifi result perhaps being a little ‚Äòsmoother‚Äô and without a single hotspot near the router.</p>

<p>But it‚Äôs the lack of problems with handoffs and roaming that are the real story here. That and the fact that I can more often use a 5GHz ac connection that was previously limited to inside my study.</p>

<p>You will have to excuse my variation in measuring points - this was not an entirely scientific method.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, I‚Äôm happy with the purchase. Once I got everything set up and working correctly it‚Äôs been a hassle-free experience. The initial experience, though, was sketchy.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd love to know if anybody has had success having a Google Wifi setup connect to an NBN connection directly through a bridged modem like my Apple Airport could. While it isn‚Äôt really a problem, the knowledge that I have a non-optimal configuration with two NAT devices operating is annoying to me.</p>

<p>Would I recommend this product to others? Yes, absolutely. I also think that most other people would have a much more successful plug and play experience than me. This is the curse of the tinkerer.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>With a hat tip to Gabe Weatherhead at <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2017/12/some-of-my-favorite-mac-applications-in-2017.html">MacDrifter</a> who put together his list of favourite Mac applications for 2017, I am following suit.</p>

<p>Third party apps are what make a platform great. Despite the macOS ecosystem perhaps not being as vibrant as it once was, it is still served by a wonderful cohort of professional and hard-working developers. Even though I‚Äôve bought their apps, I sometimes feel I owe them more because using their software is what makes using my Mac both fun and productive.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a long tail of apps I use beyond those included in this list. Yet these I have detailed below are those I used extensively in 2017 and that I value and enjoy. These are the apps that I would most miss if they suddenly went away.</p>

<h2>1Password for Families</h2>

<p>Online security is no joke. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss password hygiene as tin-foil hat material, but when you think how much of our lives are conducted online, I don‚Äôt want a veneer of security ‚Äî I want an ironclad guarantee. 1Password guarantees I can have unique complex passwords for every site that I maintain an account. I have no idea what any of these passwords are. But I do know my password to unlock 1Password. After that, it‚Äôs nothing but <code>‚åò-&lt;/code&gt; to long me in anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://1password.com/families/">1Password for Families</a> | US$4.99 per month</p>

<h2>OmniFocus</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve waxed lyrical about OmniFocus before. Without this app there is no way I would be able to keep all my balls in the air. As much as parts of its design frustrate me, and the pace of its development is glacial, it works. Every day it delivers value by making my life easier. There are sexier to-do apps out there, but OmniFocus is rock solid.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus Pro</a> | US$79.99</p>

<h2>Launchbar</h2>

<p>My wife doesn‚Äôt have Launchbar installed on her MacBook. So when I try to use it, I feel lost. After years of use Launchbar feels an extension of the operating system and is completely engrained in my muscle memory. I switched to Launchbar years ago after Quicksilver became unstable and I‚Äôve stayed ever since. I know others swear by Alfred, but I‚Äôm definitely a Launchbar guy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a> | US$29</p>

<h2>Bear</h2>

<p>I love this app even though I do have to work hard to find a truly worthwhile use for it. I definitely underuse Bear, but I really like it. For the emotional response, I‚Äôm keeping it in my list. But there is still a nagging feeling that between Apple Notes, Ulysses and DevonThink Pro, I really shouldn‚Äôt need this app. But it is <em>really nice</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear</a> | US$14.99 per year</p>

<h2>Ulysses</h2>

<p>My key authoring application in which I write blog posts, work reports and other bits and pieces. For report writing as part of my day job Ulysses has this year supplanted Scrivener. For my blogging, Ulysses has withstood challenges from Bear and MarsEdit. It is a wonderful writing app and I enjoy that I have access to it through my <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/mxocq3b5">Setapp</a> subscription. If I didn‚Äôt have Setapp, I would subscribe to Ulysses directly without a moment‚Äôs hesitation.</p>

<p><a href="https://ulyssesapp.com/">Ulysses</a> | AU$54.99 per year</p>

<h2>DEVONthink Pro</h2>

<p>The archive. The place I keep all my reference, research and archival material. I don‚Äôt use it for all that it can do; for instance I don‚Äôt create documents in DEVONthink despite it having the ability to do so. But for archiving, storing and searching, nothing beats it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/devonthink-pro.html">DEVONthink Pro</a> | AU$104.13</p>

<h2>StockMarketEye</h2>

<p>This is a cross-platform Java app, so it‚Äôs ugly as sin. It‚Äôs also about the only share market application available for Mac. Fortunately it works well and gives me all the information I need to track my portfolio.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stockmarketeye.com/">StockMarketEye</a> | US$99.95</p>

<h2>Reeder</h2>

<p>I have never given up on RSS, even through the dark days after the Google Reader shutdown. I love the independent web and follow a range of sites religiously. On the Mac Reeder is the best way to do this.</p>

<p><a href="http://reederapp.com/mac/">Reeder</a> | US$9.99</p>

<h2>PDF Expert</h2>

<p>PDF Expert has replaced Preview for PDF viewing and editing. Preview‚Äôs editing toolbars have always been inscrutable to me whereas PDF Expert makes sense. The bugginess that was introduced to the PDF engine in MacOS Sierra was the final nail in the coffin and ensured my switch to PDF Expert.</p>

<p><a href="https://pdfexpert.com/">PDF Expert</a> | US$65.99</p>

<h2>BusyCal</h2>

<p>While the native Mac calendar app has improved, I still prefer having more power and flexibility to manage my calendars. While Fantastical always gets the glory as the sexy third party calendar option, BusyCal blends in and does the job quietly and effectively. I use this app daily. Its ability to save and restore different calendar sets give me helpful insights into my scheduled life.</p>

<p><a href="http://busymac.com/busycal/index.html">BusyCal</a> | US$49.99</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am writing this post in <a href="https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. MarsEdit is an app that I have always¬†<em>wanted</em> to use, but never really have found a place for it. Now, with the new version released I thought I‚Äôd download it and give it a spin as part of the 14-day trial developer <a href="https://twitter.com/danielpunkass">Daniel Jakult</a> offers.</p>

<p>Recently I have been writing blog entries in <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com/">Ulysses</a>, which is great in that it uses iCloud for syncing and has clients for the Mac and iOS. So writing can be done anywhere. It also has a Wordpress publishing engine so I don‚Äôt need to mess around to get my words on the web. Finally, Ulysses uses a flavour of Markdown which I am becoming much more proficient in using. Of course, I also already have a licence for Ulysses as part of my <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/mxocq3b5">Setapp</a> subscription.</p>

<p>MarsEdit is a much more traditional blogging platform. It defaults to rich text, it is Mac only, and it is more ‚Äòfeature rich‚Äô than Ulysses. It offers a two-way connection to Wordpress, meaning it can download an archive blog posts in addition to simply publishing which is the limit of the Ulysses offering. With my current workflow, if I need to make an edit to a published post I have to go to Wordpress on the web and make the change. From that point on, my local copy on Ulysses is out of date; there is no concept of syncing - it just publishes. MarsEdit is fully sync-compliant so I can fix those pesky mistakes and maintain a single source of truth.</p>

<p>I do wish it had an iOS application, though. I imagine its code base is too entrenched in the Mac world to easily transition it to iOS, but it would be great to have a synced solution. This is where Ulysses excels - I can pick up the writing from where I left off from any device.</p>

<p>The other thing is typing in rich text. While ‚Äònormal‚Äô people prefer this (think users of Microsoft Word, which is rich text throughout) for blogging I do tend to prefer using plain text and Markdown. The code is apparent, I know what is happening, and it is easy to read. My experience with rich text transitions to HTML is that things go wonky. Of course, MarsEdit can edit in plain text and apply a Markdown filter, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like its natural mode of operation.</p>

<p>As I write this, I have been stumped as to how to add a footnote without resorting to pure HTML. In Ulysses with Markdown, this is an easy thing to do. In MarsEdit, it‚Äôs not apparent.</p>

<p>Using MarsEdit for this post has been an interesting adventure, but at this stage and for the type of blogging I do, I don‚Äôt think this app is for me.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/11/25/podcast-addiction.html">Podcast Addiction</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/11/25/podcast-addiction.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-11-25 19:41:57 &#43;0800">Nov 25, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts. I‚Äôve been listening to podcasts for more than 10 years, way before they were mainstream. I used to load podcasts onto my work-supplied IBM ThinkPad<sup id="fnref-322-1"><a href="#fn-322-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> and drive to work with it open on the passenger seat, playing podcasts. This was before I owned an iPod, let alone an iPhone. I think I may have been listening to <a href="http://curry.com">Adam Curry</a> at the time - there weren‚Äôt that many podcasts out there, and his was one of the first.</p>

<p>Since that time, I‚Äôve never given up my podcasts habit. In fact, it‚Äôs gotten worse. <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a>, my current podcast player of choice says that I‚Äôve saved 197 hours with Smart Speed (a setting that eliminates small pauses within normal speech). That‚Äôs 8.2 days saved via a very small tweak. So how many days worth of my life have I dedicated to podcast listening? I am glad I can‚Äôt find out!</p>

<p>My podcast listening trends have changed over the years. I had a multi-year phase with Leo Laporte‚Äôs network, listening to <a href="https://www.twit.tv/shows/macbreak-weekly">MacBreak Weekly</a>, <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/weekly-daily-giz-wiz">The Daily Giz Wiz</a> and <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech">This Week in Tech</a>. Now I don‚Äôt listen to any of them. The ‚Äòindi‚Äô podcasts I replaced the Laporte shows with have now themselves grown to be pretty big businesses in their own right.</p>

<p>Listening to podcasts is really a continuation of something I have done since I was little. Since I was about 5 years old I have fallen asleep listening to spoken word. Initially it was books on tape. Then I spent years listening to <a href="https://www.australianoftheyear.org.au/honour-roll/?view=fullView&amp;recipientID=1248">Graham Mayberry</a>‚Äôs show on Perth local radio. Then I graduated to falling asleep to BBC World Service. Listening to speech has been a huge part of my life, and now podcasts provide an awesome delivery method far better than radio or cassette tape!</p>

<h2>My subscriptions today</h2>

<p>My podcast subscriptions today are a straight representation of my interests. I have a lot of technology subscriptions, a few basketball ones, politics and world news and some light entertainment. Looking at the overall list, I‚Äôm not sure how I manage to listen to them all. But I carve out time. Mainly it‚Äôs when I‚Äôm driving or doing some menial task around the house.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> I saw recently that others had shared their podcast lists, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cdevroe.com/2017/06/16/podcasts-2017/">Colin Devroe</a></li>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/11/24/dealing-with-illness.html">Dealing with Illness</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/11/24/dealing-with-illness.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-11-24 11:55:42 &#43;0800">Nov 24, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A few months ago I was unfortunate enough to contract <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis">Glandular fever</a> and I am still suffering the effects of it now. The virus started out as what appeared to be the flu, but after I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of fatigue and general malaise for weeks after the flu symptoms ended I decided to go the doctor. Subsequent blood tests confirmed the glandular fever diagnosis. Normally this is a virus associated more with teenagers, so I am surprised to have contracted it at the ripe old age of 40.</p>

<p>The impact this illness has had on my ability to work effectively has been significant. Beyond the physical problems it has been a struggle to establish mental focus and remain concentrated on a task. I have had periods of forgetfulness and an incoherent mind. Making this worse from a working perspective is that there are not any external symptoms of the problem. This can make it hard for others to appreciate the truth that I am struggling to function. In a consulting environment, it becomes hard to step away from work when there aren‚Äôt any visible health problems.</p>

<h2>Managing customer expectations</h2>

<p>The client-focused consulting work that I do is not particularly conducive to long periods of leave linked to sickness. My work is a conduit for the success of other people‚Äôs goals and I need to fit in with their operational timelines. I engage with companies on the premise that our work will be done in a timely fashion. Often I am fitting my work around other projects they have on the go so any delays I create can have other knock-on effects. To suddenly need to take a lengthy break because of an illness that is not visibly apparent - but is impacting my mental state considerably - is a difficult thing.</p>

<p>Managing expectations in these circumstances is a challenge, because I don‚Äôt even know what I can promise in terms of timelines. The best I have found I can do is to be upfront and honest about the situation, and trust there will be a level of empathy from the client I am working with.</p>

<h2>Managing self-imposed pressures</h2>

<p>Even harder than managing the expectations of others are managing the expectations I place on myself. I‚Äôm self-motivated and I structure my projects and set deadlines to ensure I stay on track and maintain momentum. Having an illness that impacts my ability to meet these deadlines is a frustration that can tend to eat away at me.</p>

<p>I worry that I‚Äôm letting others down, and the feeling of ‚Äòfalling behind‚Äô is not one I like. I have to take time to remind myself that I can‚Äôt always work with maximum efficiency; that I‚Äôm a living being who will have ups and downs. I need to let go, give myself time to recover and be assured that I will be able to catch up at a later point.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I just need to accept that stuff will just have to wait, and sometimes there is nothing that can be done about that.</p>

<h2>Phone messages</h2>

<p>Finally, a note on voicemail. They are the bane of my existence even in normal circumstances. When I‚Äôm sick, and a number of them bank up, it‚Äôs even worse. Seriously, voicemail is terrible, and it should be banished. With so many other options for communication, why is voicemail still a thing?</p>

Tonight I‚Äôve sketched out my basic IT storage system and the cloud services I use on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Ensuring that my storage network all hangs together with everything accessible from multiple devices and platforms while also maintaining redundancy through an <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">appropriate backup strategy</a> is not easy. I think I have my bases covered but it‚Äôs not particularly simple.</p>

<p>Despite the complexity it remains a problem worth worrying about. I don‚Äôt ever want to stress about losing data. Photos especially are memories that cannot be recreated so I really want to make sure I‚Äôve got them secured in multiple locations, while also ensuring that an accidental deletion in one location will not replicate that deletion across the entire network.</p>

<h2>Cloud sync services</h2>

<p>My cloud sync services; iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive and Google Drive, all provide mechanisms to make data available across multiple devices. iCloud of course also offers additional photo sync services, and sync of device settings.</p>

<p>My work lives in OneDrive because corporations and Microsoft.</p>

<p>None of these should be considered a true backup because deletions replicate and there is limited version management. I see these as a sync platform only, and never rely on them as a backup.</p>

<p>I am annoyed by the number of cloud services I am having to use. It would be great to have a single sync service to rule them all. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be happening anytime soon.</p>

<h2>Other cloud services</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnipresence">OmniPresence</a> is a service that keeps documents made by OmniGroup synced between macOS and iOS. I wish I could ditch it, but I‚Äôm not entirely confident that moving these files to iCloud will work, so I continue to have it running.</p>

<p>Adobe Creative Cloud is a service I‚Äôm not taking full advantage of because I still prefer the Lightroom Classic and managing photos from local storage.</p>

<h2>Local storage</h2>

<p>I have a Network Attached Storage for mass storage of data, which is primarily photos and video. This is necessary because my local Mac hard drive is a relatively tiny SSD which almost always seems on the verge of filling up.</p>

<h2>Local backups</h2>

<p>I maintain a few local backups:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Time Machine backup that is stored on my NAS.</li>
<li>a <a href="http://shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> clone of my MacBook‚Äôs drive. If something goes wrong I can boot from this clone and run from that external drive, or recover files as necessary.</li>
<li>a USB hard drive that connects to my Mac, and with the help of <a href="https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html">Chronosync</a>, ensures that photos are copied from my NAS to this storage that is seen as a drive locally connected to my Mac<sup id="fnref-284-1"><a href="#fn-284-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The last resort</h2>

<p><a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/012t34">Backblaze</a> is my backup of last resort. If anything goes horribly wrong, I should be able to retrieve data from this location. Backblaze operates to ensure that my MacBook, and any locally attached drives, are backed up to their cloud storage, which includes all the data that is also stored across the cloud services such as Dropbox and OneDrive.</p>

<p>All this might seem like overkill but there is no way that I want to risk losing data that I can‚Äôt get back. The little bit of effort, and the little bit of money to pay for the software and services I consider a worthwhile exchange for peace of mind.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Over the past five years I‚Äôve spent a lot of time learning the fundamental philosophies of a production system known as <em>lean</em>. I‚Äôve read books and articles, I‚Äôve taken a study tour to see lean in action in Japan. I‚Äôve developed lean guides for business, and coached companies in the theory and implementation. Yet despite all of this, I still consider myself a beginner<sup id="fnref-279-1"><a href="#fn-279-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Most of my lean work has been in relation to the manufacturing sector but the principles can also be applied to healthcare, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place">food preparation</a>, administration, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_IT">software development</a>, to name a few. IT has even created further derivations such as kanban and agile.</p>

<h2>Lean origins</h2>

<p>Toyota is the company that can be credited for originally demonstrating the value of lean through their own Toyota Production System. Implemented with the help of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming">Edward Deming</a> after World War II, the company has embraced the lean philosophy of <em>continuous improvement</em> ever since. The company is now the gold standard with respect to lean implementation.</p>

<p>The theory of lean is much like an onion: there are many layers to it (and implementing it might sometimes make you cry!) Trying to emulate the Toyota Production System at the outset is an effort not worth taking, but any company can do implement some simple elements without too much trouble if they commit.</p>

<h2>The best way to start</h2>

<p>To get started I recommend following the exact same advice my Grandma used to give:</p>

<blockquote>
  ‚Äúa place for everything and everything in its place‚Äù
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it‚Äôs as easy as that.</p>

<p>This concept represents one of the basic tenets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S_%28methodology%29">5S</a>. 5S is all about keeping things neat and orderly within the context of a lean workplace. Make sure if you take something, use something, or move something, that it gets put back once it has served its purpose. This approach will make it easier for your future self or somebody else to find a thing in the future. It will prevent the need to buy another thing because you couldn‚Äôt find the original thing. It will reduce stress and anger when you can‚Äôt find the thing you need at the time you need it.‚Ä®
Simply make sure everything has a home and that it always lives at home when not in use. Good tip, Grandma.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Twitter continues to descend into a morass of bad behaviour while simultaneously floundering in search of a viable business model that might deliver a return for the billions in capital it has consumed<sup id="fnref-269-1"><a href="#fn-269-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>. The future of Twitter does not look bright, either socially or financially. As a result, I am experimenting with other platforms for expressing my random and (inconsequential?) thoughts.</p>

<p>Facebook, while having a more profitable and successful business model, is still yucky for a bunch of other reasons. These are predominantly centred around the fact that all of the content is just grist for their sales model. Facebook is a classic walled garden, and the business depends on keeping you active and contained within their domain.</p>

<p>One of the things that got me interested in the internet in the early-to-mid 1990‚Äôs was the <em>open-ness</em> of it all. Anybody could publish anything, and it was all equally accessible. The Internet removed the barriers created by Bulletin Board Systems and Compuserve and delivered an open, level playing field. Since then, we have gone full circle, and now we are providing our content free of charge, directly to private companies like Twitter and Facebook (including Instagram) which they are then able to monetise for their own benefit.</p>

<h2>Micro.blog</h2>

<p><a href="https://manton.org/">Manton Reece</a> has built an interesting alternative to these closed systems. With the help of Kickstarter funding, he created <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>. This is a system designed to allow the publishing of short posts, in the same style as tweets, but built upon a foundation of open access. In my instance, I can post an entry at micro.blog. Through the magic of RSS, micro.blog makes available a <a href="http://micro.blog/canion">content feed</a> but the material is actually being published and hosted via my own Wordpress blog. For the time being, I have set up a separate page from this blog to display <a href="http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/category/microblog/">my micro.blog entries</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, this is far from a mainstream approach. It‚Äôs not nearly as easy as setting up a new Twitter account. There is only a relatively small, pretty nerdy community using micro.blog at the moment. Of course, that‚Äôs also how Twitter started, back when it was good.</p>

<h2>Cross-posting</h2>

<p>Discoverability of content becomes the challenge when working outside the established networks. For the moment, I still have my micro-blog entries cross-posting to Facebook and Twitter. If I didn‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs likely that <em>nobody</em> <sup id="fnref-269-2"><a href="#fn-269-2" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> would be able to enjoy my witty repartee. While cross-posting is not ideal, at least I‚Äôm only providing those sites with links that track back to my own content - I‚Äôm not just feeding their machines. If I quit the service, or if they fail, I will still have my content in my possession, at my own hosted site.</p>

<h2>The Open Web</h2>

<p>This concept of my content being mine, and to have it accessible outside the walled gardens created by the Internet behemoths that are private companies with their duty to act in the interests of shareholders - not users, is the essence of the open web.</p>

<p>Being able to link to content with direct URLs, and to have that content able to be indexed by search engines, is part of the open web also.</p>

<p>Of course there are still financial transactions and business relationships involved but they are apparent. I pay a <a href="https://ventraip.com.au">hosting company</a> money. In exchange they provide me with storage space, access to a web server and a connection to the Internet. There is no middle-man, no other services are trying to monetise or advertise against my content. It‚Äôs pure and straightforward. The content remains mine, to do with as I wish.</p>

<p>Finally, of course, noodling around with all of this is also a really great hobby.</p>

         	<p><em>This is the final of a three-part series focused on explaining my business philosophy. Parts <a href="http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/09/part-1-my-business-philosophy/">One</a> and <a href="http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/10/part-2-my-business-philosophy/">Two</a> are also available.</em></p>

<p>On my <a href="https://andrewcanion.com">home page</a> I call out my personal business philosophy:</p>

<blockquote>
  Andrew's business philosophy is built upon the value of mutual respect, the skill to leverage process for continuous improvement, and the ability to ultimately achieve self-actualisation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Self-Actualisation</h2>

<p>My philosophical statement finishes with the rather grand sounding ambition of achieving self-actualisation. I will elucidate what self-actualisation is and why I consider it so important that I place it as the anchoring element of my philosophy.</p>

<h3>Etymology</h3>

<p>The concept of self-actualisation was brought into broad awareness when it was presented as the pinnacle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs">Abraham Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs</a>.</p>

<p>Maslow&rsquo;s rationale was based upon the understanding that only after the more immediate human needs are taken care of, is there capacity to focus effort on what brings us satisfaction and joy.</p>

<blockquote>
  Maslow explicitly defines self-actualisation to be "the desire for self-fulfilment, namely the tendency for the individual to become actualised in what he is potentially. This tendency might be phrased as the desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming.‚Äù<sup id="fnref-261-1"><a href="#fn-261-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, in my country and its society there is a reasonable (but not guaranteed) chance to achieve the lower rungs of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy. This unlocks the potential to aim for and potentially achieve that final goal of self-actualisation.</p>

<h3>Building a framework</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see self-actualisation as an end-point; as the win achieved at the conclusion of a life-long progression up the hierarchy of needs. I believe we can reach the point of self-actualisation early and often, but what it is represented by will change over time. As we move through the stages of our life, commencing with childhood, then into the teens, marriage, career building, parenting, middle age and senior citizenship, different experiences will facilitate the goal.</p>

<p>The degree to which we are realising self-actualisation is likely to ebb and flow over time. Building a framework for our life that supports personal growth and improvement will help ensure a reasonable chance of reaching periods of self-actualisation even as we deal with the trials and tribulations thrown at as by life.</p>

<p>Without a structure and a consistent philosophical and ethical approach to life to fall back upon in challenging times it is less likely that consistent self-actualisation will be achievable.</p>

<h3>Measuring success</h3>

<p>Society has a tendency to measure success by outward facing and tangible measures such as wealth, fame and status. I prefer to think about success as the achievement of one‚Äôs potential and the personal joy imbued from doing what makes us happy. Precisely what the activity is that delivers said joy will vary as we grow and change. Exactly what it is matters less than the feeling it provides.</p>

<p>At one point of my life, playing basketball delivered a feeling of self-actualisation. Then later it was finding flow in a work assignment. Now it is linked to experiences of successful parenting. I am sure it will be other things later. None of these achievements are important to others<sup id="fnref-261-2"><a href="#fn-261-2" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I am not being successful in my own right. If we are seeking external validation it will a frustrating and largely unrewarding experience, because that&rsquo;s not delivered with any regularity.</p>

<h3>The journey is the reward</h3>

<p>There is no prize for &lsquo;winning life&rsquo;. External plaudits cannot be the arbiter of a life well-lived. We have been gifted a single life which even at the most optimistic is probably going to span less than 100 years. Against the timeline of humanity we are but granted a short window of opportunity. To bring meaning and purpose to our time on the planet we may as well participate with an aim of achieving joy and self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many symbols of success we collect along life‚Äôs journey. The true measure should be our own happiness and fulfilment. Recognising each day as a gift to be enjoyed and maximised is a path towards self-actualisation. Find your joy, wherever it may be.</p>

<h2>Bringing the philosophy together</h2>

<p>So, ultimately, I like to think that in respect of my business philosophy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mutual respect will help avoid many worries, anger and pettiness that can derail us as we build a career and/or a business.</li>
<li>Establishing a process for continuous improvement will free our mind to focus on truly meaningful work, rather than busy work.</li>
<li>By adopting a respectful approach to others and having a focus on always getting better, a person can grow self-confidence, self-satisfaction and their enjoyment of life in its entirety, which will form a pathway towards achieving self-actualisation.</li>
</ol>

         	<p><em>This is the second of a three-part series focused on explaining my business philosophy. <a href="http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/09/part-1-my-business-philosophy/">Part One</a> is also available.</em></p>

<p>On my <a href="https://andrewcanion.com">home page</a> I call out my personal business philosophy:</p>

<blockquote>
  Andrew's business philosophy is built upon the value of mutual respect, the skill to leverage process for continuous improvement, and the ability to ultimately achieve self-actualisation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Leverage Process for Continuous Improvement</h2>

<p>I am a big believer in the value of process. This can be the big, organisational processes that dictate how companies do things, like build a component, or undertake customer service, or issue a refund. Or process can be an individual‚Äôs personal to-do list that helps them to get things done on a daily basis. Ideally the latter should represent a subset of the former but I think we are probably some way from that ideal being standard practice.</p>

<p>When processes are documented they provide an anchor point as to the way things are done <em>now</em>. That‚Äôs not to say that it is the way things will always be done. In fact, changes to processes should be welcomed. However, a documented process enables everybody involved to have a shared understanding of how things should be done. If something goes wrong it should be evident where the process broke down. That can enable improvements to improve efficiency and simplify things for those involved.</p>

<h3>Embrace change</h3>

<p>A process should never be considered a finalised product. Stagnation is the enemy of improvement. No way of work should be considered beyond reproach. No process should be sacrosanct.</p>

<p>A current process is merely the way in which one group of people at one point in time thought would be the best way to achieve an outcome. With new information, new technology, changed inputs, or changes in customer demand, there might be a need to change the process to achieve a better ‚Äî or just different ‚Äî outcome. Go ahead, make the change. The only way to drive improvement is to change stuff. Otherwise, you already know what you‚Äôre going to get before even starting. Repeating this approach of making and trialling small changes, over and over again, is how to achieve better outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
  Trial and error and small incremental improvements are the crux of continuous improvement.
</blockquote>

<p>Once a process of documenting processes and updating this documentation upon each change is established a traceable (and reversible) process history is created. In software development, this is standard practice - managing versions and being able to compare code differences is a key element of development and debugging.</p>

<p>More generalised process management can benefit from a similar approach. Make a change and see if it works. If things get better after the change, stick with it. If things get worse, revert the changes and try something different.</p>

<h3>Process at a personal level</h3>

<p>At a personal level I implement process management for my own work. I rely primarily on <a href="http://omnigroup.com/omnifocus" title="OmniFocus">OmniFocus</a> to manage standard operating procedures for projects that are repetitive in nature. I use project templates that enable a framework to guide work that is similar in nature. As I learn and discover better ways of doing things I refine and improve my templates.</p>

<p>This makes my work more effective in the short-term because I don‚Äôt have to think about the how/when/where‚Äôs of the repetitive work elements. Instead I can focus my energy on doing great work on the value-adding elements of the project that matter to my clients.</p>

<h3>Facilitating creativity</h3>

<p>At first blush, the concept of defined processes can seem staid and boring. In actuality it is freeing. Defined and documented processes allows people to forget about thinking about the steps to achieve a goal and instead allows them to focus on using their skills and expertise to add value to create a better end product.</p>

<p>Process doesn‚Äôt restrain creativity; it unleashes it. For this reason it forms the key middle component of my personal business philosophy.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><em>This is the first of a three-part series focused on explaining my business philosophy.</em></p>

<p>On my <a href="https://andrewcanion.com">home page</a> I call out my personal business philosophy:</p>

<blockquote>
  Andrew's business philosophy is built upon the value of <strong>mutual respect</strong>, the skill to leverage process for continuous improvement, and the ability to ultimately achieve self-actualisation.
</blockquote>

<h2>Mutual Respect</h2>

<p>To make progress in this world we need teamwork and co-operation. High performing teams are built around trust and respect for one another.</p>

<p>Even in a competitive environment there can be mutual respect. If you are beaten by a better performer, there is value in recognising their success and then using that as motivation to improve your own performance. Winners should stay humble and respect the competition that may not have succeeded this time, but might get the better of them next time around. Staying humble helps build respect.</p>

<h3>Managerial respect</h3>

<p>If a manager wants to get the most out of their employees, I believe they need to demonstrate respect and understanding for those they are asking to undertake the work. Acting with respect will build trust in leadership. Without trust it is difficult to achieve anything great. Time and and focus will be lost to people questioning what ulterior motives are in play, what forces might be working against them, and how to move into a position to win. More time is spent focused on self-preservation than on achieving team success. In such an environment it is unlikely that the team will be high-performing.</p>

<p>A manager who respects their employees is likely to create a team with better camaraderie, better stability and a desire to deliver great outcomes.</p>

<h3>Employee respect</h3>

<p>Employees need to understand that their managers may be seeing the situation from a different vantage point. After climbing the organisational tree, the view from that altitude often looks very different. Much like a general might take to an elevated vantage point to survey the field, a manager may have a perspective on things that can&rsquo;t be perceived at ground level.</p>

<p>An employee needs to appreciate and understand that the manager is likely to be balancing multiple competing pressures, and have respect for that challenge confronting their manager. This respect through understanding will help both parties.</p>

<h3>Respectful reciprocity</h3>

<p>A manager and an employee; co-workers and colleagues; buyers and sellers; all of these relationships rely on mutual respect to operate effectively. Each is a participant in a process chain. Mutual respect is about working to make the life of others a little easier, and a little better. This establishes a positive reciprocal relationship. If somebody is respectful towards me it is likely I will treat them with respect in return. Everybody enjoys a better experience.</p>

<p>I believe that demonstrating respect for colleagues is the foundation for all other elements of business. If you don‚Äôt treat others with respect, it‚Äôs unlikely you will go far. Others aren&rsquo;t likely to be willing to go out of the way to provide help and support if you haven&rsquo;t been respectful on the way through. Nobody gets to wherever they are alone. We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before. Acting with respect offers a chance for others to stand on ours.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/09/06/the-business-of.html">The Business of Glengarry Glen Ross</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/09/06/the-business-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-09-06 22:12:03 &#43;0800">Sep 6, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I love the movie <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>. I‚Äôve never seen the stage play, but the movie seems to be a faithful translation and its actors are all top shelf, so I‚Äôm willing to accept it as canonical<sup id="fnref-184-1"><a href="#fn-184-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Despite the dated nature of the film‚Äôs setting, much continues to ring true about the circumstances in which the protagonists find themselves. Desperate times, leading to desperate measures, with each character dealing with the same adversity in their own varied ways.</p>

<p>This could be considered an accurate reflection of the human condition when people are put within an organisational structure that is essentially a manufactured construct with appointed &lsquo;leaders&rsquo; and abstracted hierarchy. Each person has their own motivation and varying degrees to which they will go to get what they want. At some point, teamwork will collapse as individuals strive to assert themselves and &lsquo;win&rsquo;, putting self before team. It becomes a case of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the deep conflict that propel the movie, there are some other scenes that also neatly capture smaller elements of working life. When I‚Äôm talking to somebody on the phone to schedule a meeting, I‚Äôm sometimes ever so tempted to pause and say, ‚ÄúOh Grace, would you mind checking my schedule‚Äù, just to proffer the illusion that it‚Äôs more than just me and <a href="https://www.busymac.com/busycal/">BusyCal</a> managing the load.</p>

<p>Alec Baldwin‚Äôs performance as the slick sales consultant rings true, and as much as it is a comedic moment, the enjoyment is almost excruciating given the truth behind the message. It is one that sticks with me and even does help from time to time in reality. That lesson, ‚ÄúA. B. C. - Always Be Closing‚Äù. Sometimes this forms part of my internal monologue when I&rsquo;m talking to people!</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182" src="http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/7d1532fe5d.jpg" width="794" height="336" /></p>

<h2>The Glengarry Leads</h2>

<p>Ultimately, what everybody in the movie wants is possession of the Glengarry leads. The <em>good</em> leads. In my work, I also want the Glengarry leads. I want introductions to the firms that are going to understand what my offer is, sign up, and work in a positive way through to conclusion.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-181" src="http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/738b974d5b.jpg" width="720" height="304" /></p>

<p>It would be great for management to dish out some of those good leads. Don‚Äôt hold them back, share them out! This is where I think reality diverges from the plot of the movie. More often than not, I think reality is that management doesn‚Äôt actually have <em>any</em> Glengarry leads. They might have a nice stack of cards that look like they&rsquo;re going to be great leads but if you were to examine them there may be a good chance they are more Glen Ross than Glengarry. Really, the promise of the Glengarry leads is simply a motivational method to drive sales of whatever dreck does exist. &ldquo;Deal with what we&rsquo;ve got, and <em>then</em> you will get something better&rdquo;, is a fairly basic motivational ploy.</p>

<p>The problem is that better doesn‚Äôt necessarily exist; at least not in the hands of management. If you really want the Glengarry leads, you‚Äôd best go out and find them yourself.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/09/04/internet-services-worth.html">Internet Services Worth Paying For</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/09/04/internet-services-worth.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-09-04 23:39:48 &#43;0800">Sep 4, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>On the Internet there is a weird user expectation that everything should be free. Over the past couple of years I&rsquo;ve been bucking this trend and have determined that spending a bit of money on what is both a hobby and an integral part of my existence in our modern, connected world is something I&rsquo;m willing to throw a bit of money towards.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be the product; I want to be the customer. Paying money for a service to avoid my usage being a vector to sell advertising is a trade-off I am happy to make.</p>

<p>The other nice thing about paying for services is that it facilitates access to genuinely useful customer support. As a paying customer companies tend to care a little more about ensuring satisfaction. Having problems solved by a system administrator instead of wasting my own time futzing about can make a subscription worthwhile. I value my time, and where money can buy time, I&rsquo;m in.</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d take a quick audit and look at the areas online where I am willingly paying money in favour of a free option.</p>

<h2>Ciao Google</h2>

<p>The biggest change was a move away from many Google services. While Google offers its GSuite as a paid option (and a pretty good one at that), I elected to go a different route.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always preferred native apps and have never loved the Gmail web interface. As a free service it&rsquo;s fine but if I&rsquo;m paying real money I don&rsquo;t want to be spending it on something I don&rsquo;t enjoy using.</p>

<p>If I were an Android user, the Google situation might be more compelling. On iOS, however, there always seems to be a little friction between what Google wants and what Apple is prepared to give.</p>

<p>So I bid adieu to Google, and took my business elsewhere.</p>

<h2>My Paid Providers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mail &amp; Calendars: <a href="http://fastmail.com">Fastmail</a>. I evaluated Office 365, GSuite and Zoho when making the choice. I only wanted really good email and calendars; I didn't need online storage, office applications, and other bolt-on services. I like that Fastmail is an Australian firm and that it has a focus on standards compliance.</li>
<li>Domain registration: <a href="http://zuver.net.au">Zuver</a>. The little brother of VentraIP. It is a great no-frills option, and they were having a product sale when I signed up.</li>
<li>Web hosting: <a href="http://ventraip.com.au">VentraIP</a>. Another Australian company that offers great support service. Their servers are fast and I am provided a web hosting solution that is perfect for my needs.</li>
<li>Personal finance: <a href="http://youneedabudget.com">YNAB</a>. Our family is in the best financial position of all time thanks largely to YNAB. No arguments about money in our home! The cost of this service is a pittance compared with the value (both monetary and stress relief) it has delivered.</li>
<li>Password security: <a href="https://1password.com/families/">1Password for Families</a>. The best security is not even knowing your own passwords. I am totally willing to pay to ensure all my online accounts (plus credit card details, etc.) are unique, random and locked down. It's peace of mind.</li>
<li>Entertainment: <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a> and <a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a>. I'm hardly a special snowflake here, right? Broadcast media is dead to me.</li>
<li>Photo Storage: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238">iCloud</a> 50Gb. Apple has me over a barrel here. Despite maintaining local backups, the ubiquity of photos being available to all my devices is too good not to take up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bits and Bobs</h3>

<p>I also pay for a few other subscription apps and online services but I don&rsquo;t consider them to be part of my &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; so am not going to list them all here.</p>

<h2>The Customer is the One Who Pays</h2>

<p>Money makes the world go around. It pays employee wages, funds infrastructure acquisition and incentivises the implementation of new ideas. I&rsquo;d rather be a direct customer paying my own way, and helping companies do good work than rely on the largesse of search and banner advertising to underwrite my online activity.</p>

<p>While I pay the bills, I call the shots. This is true in all business, and online services shouldn&rsquo;t be seen any differently.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The internet relies on DNS servers that do the dirty work of translating human readable domain names to something that makes sense to a device on a network, which is where you see four sequences of numbers separated by a period.</p>

<p>I have been updating my homepage at <a href="http://andrewcanion.com">andrewcanion.com</a> such that it displays the three latest blog posts I have published by leveraging the RSS feed generated by Wordpress. RSS feeds provide a method for other sites and services to subscribe to the work of the site offering the feed. Each new entry is included in the RSS feed, and for my homepage, I grab the latest three entries for prominent display.</p>

<h2>What should have worked, didn‚Äôt</h2>

<p>I had assumed that this would all work well until I stumbled across a strange problem. My site would only occasionally load and display the article entries contained within the feed. Other times the articles would not display, instead pausing in a state of permanent loading. I tried the site across a number of devices, and a number of browsers to eliminate a problem existing at the device level. As they all exhibited the same issue I presumed the problem must be occurring at a deeper level of the network.</p>

<p>I examined the source code of my site and it appeared to be fine. I checked to make sure the Yahoo API that grabbed the RSS feed and translated it for use on my home page was still active, and it was.</p>

<p>Next I tried connecting to the site through a VPN, which makes it appear that my point of origin was somewhere other than through my own internet connection. When using a VPN the site loaded every time. This was great to discover, as it moved me another step closer to the identifying the problem.</p>

<p>That problem had to be related to my ISP (or in the new nomenclature of Australia‚Äôs NBN, my RSP). Somehow, that provider must have been causing a problem because when I routed around them with the VPN (on any device) my site loaded completely. Yet when I visited the site on any of my devices that didn‚Äôt connect through the VPN there was a problem.</p>

<p>My theory is that my RSP is aggressively caching content to attempt to reduce global bandwidth consumption and that this is preventing my RSS feed from updating correctly. If my caching theory isn‚Äôt correct, then it must be some other shenanigans they are up to at the network level, no doubt to reduce their bandwidth bill.</p>

<h2>Applying the fix</h2>

<p>To resolve the problem I needed to reduce my reliance on my provider‚Äôs infrastructure. That meant transitioning to a different DNS provider rather than using the default, which is the DNS server of my RSP. I chose to connect to <a href="https://www.opendns.com">OpenDNS</a>. Basically this means I have traded in the internet lookup tables that came with my broadband subscription in favour of an offering from a third party whose primary business it is to provide good DNS. Through the nature of their product and their business model they are incentivised to provide excellent DNS services. It is their core business. For my RSP, however, the provision of DNS services is a necessary sideline and their key driver is not to deliver excellent routing, but rather to use it as a point of leverage to reduce their own bandwidth costs to improve the profitability of their company.</p>

<p>As soon as I switched to OpenDNS my site loaded perfectly in every browser, on every device. My detective work had paid off and my willingness to not accept the defaults has improved the situation.</p>

<p>The only potential downside I was worried about was that OpenDNS might be a little slower to resolve sites simply because the distance to their server might be further than the default DNS server. I needn‚Äôt have worried though, because if anything, I think it might be a little bit faster.</p>

<h2>The lesson</h2>

<p>Companies all share an incentive to maximise profitability. How they go about achieving this can vary greatly depending on their product and their business model. My internet provider only needs to provide a service that is ‚Äògood enough‚Äô for the majority of normal customers that want to browse the web and check Facebook. If they can deliver that to satisfaction and save some money on the back-end with caching and other network tricks, they‚Äôll do it, even if it creates some edge-case problems.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm an edge-case and I wanted excellent DNS services. To get these I had to go to a company that is incentivised to provide quality DNS management. For them, only by delivering on that promise can the business generate revenue and grow its own profitability.</p>

<p>The character of Lester Freeman sums this up in this slightly NSFW scene from <em>The Wire</em>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I‚Äôm not one for new year‚Äôs resolutions but at the beginning of this year I decided to try incorporating mindfulness meditation into my life. This was an idea brought about by a feeling that I was living life in a semi-permanent state of anxiety; feeling the pressure of the now and the next thing to be done that was sneaking up behind that. I figured that some mindful meditation might offer a way in which I could carve out some time to intentionally slow myself down and try to alleviate some of that perceived stress.</p>

<p>To facilitate the practice of meditation, I found <a href="https://www.headspace.com">Headspace</a>. After enjoying the free trial I subscribed to an annual plan. Since my purchase, I‚Äôve also discovered (but haven‚Äôt tried) a free, Australian equivalent, <a href="https://smilingmind.com.au">Smiling Mind</a>.</p>

<p>As somebody who had never traversed the path of mindfulness and meditation, I had no idea what to do, how to do it, nor what to expect from it. The great thing about Headspace is that it assumes this is the case for its new users. The app provides a helpful introductory course that helps guide one into the technique and its potential benefits.</p>

<p>For the first few months, I was intentional about carving out 10-15 minutes each day for the exercise. Within a couple of weeks I found it had a positive impact on my state of mind, and each day I looked forward to the time where I could intentionally sit and do nothing. However, life being what it is, after about five months I found I was going days without meditating, and the habit that had been forming once again dissipated.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks, I‚Äôve made another conscious effort to undertake a session of meditation each day and once again I am enjoying the benefits it confers. Now, heading towards the end of August, my total meditation time recorded in the Headspace app is at about 1,000 minutes<sup id="fnref-132-1"><a href="#fn-132-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> which equates to a bit less than 17 hours.</p>

<p>In these days of hyper-connectivity and a constant barrage of (often self-inflicted) interruptions, we are lacking quality time for ourselves. It‚Äôs hard to ‚Äòunplug‚Äô from the world. In response, taking a few minutes out of each day to dedicate to my own peace of mind seems a sensible investment. The greater sense of calm I feel after a mindfulness meditation session helps with focus thereafter and so the time ‚Äòlost‚Äô to the meditation activity is quickly made up through increased productivity. Plus, nobody is so important that they can‚Äôt be incommunicado for 15 minutes, especially me!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>While I‚Äôve grown up on the Internet, I also remember the pre-internet era well and spent most of my formative years there. I was a kid who was able to get a modem and connect it to the text-only world of Bulletin Board Systems and Usenet (when Usenet was a service for discussion, not just binaries). I spent hours exploring these worlds, finding like-minded people, and expanding my horizons as to what computers could enable by way of communication and engagement.</p>

<p>I was so excited on the day I got my own internet-based email address, until I realised I had nobody to email.<sup id="fnref-128-1"><a href="#fn-128-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> Nevertheless, it was still a thrill to have the possibility of contacting anybody else in the world who may also have happened to have an email address. The open nature of email was really the first indicator of the power of the open internet.</p>

<p>As time went by, I kept up with the technology of the time. I remember skipping accounting classes at university because I was having more fun in the Unix labs browsing the web with Lynx. Later in my uni career, I would be skipping classes and browsing the web with an early version of Netscape Navigator. It was slow, but it was the future and I wanted a piece of it. The only web sites that were around at that point were really published by other geeks and there was a real sense of open exploration of what could be achieved. I still have memories of the early IMDB site, and even then the amount of information available was astounding.</p>

<p>The next port of call for me on my journey through the open web was blogging. I operated a since-departed (photo)blog that managed to gain a bit of traction and traffic over the few years that I ran it. This was back when hand-coding and CSS tweaking was a necessity, and there was no thought of, or need for, responsive design. Eventually though, I got tired of the whole thing and shut it down. I kept a text archive of the posts which I still have somewhere, and little bits of it remain at the Internet Archive. Sometimes, though, I wish I had been a better archivist of my own work even if just so I could look back on it from time to time.</p>

<p>After this time the web became ‚Äòsocialised‚Äô, in that all the action was on various social media platforms, be it MySpace(!), Facebook, Twitter, Instagram‚Ä¶ the list goes on. The problem with all of these sites, though, is they are not open. Far from it; their motivation is to keep both you and your content captive to their walled garden so they can sell advertising based on your eyeballs.</p>

<p>These sites do not reflect the open web that I‚Äôve always loved. I miss the days of easily-shareable content, where all that was required was a URL. I really wish that content wasn‚Äôt so reliant on companies as content platforms and that so much of the content wasn&rsquo;t published simply as a means of monetising the attention of others.</p>

<p>This is why I am particularly interested in the currently-in-development <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> service. This appears to have the potential of offering the best of both worlds: the ease of use of social media, but with the open web philosophy that I so appreciate. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt part of the original Kickstarter project, so I don‚Äôt have any early access. I have, however, signed up to be notified and am following the developers RSS feed closely to watch it‚Äôs development. I really hope that it gets some genuine traction, and that this can lead to real-world success.</p>

<p>I know that we can&rsquo;t go back to the way things were. The internet will never again be the Wild West, inhabited only by the zealot explorers. Now it&rsquo;s a platform for everybody, and the commercial money isn&rsquo;t going away anytime soon. Yet I will keep my RSS reader and maintain the search for those independent voices that I  can follow who create and deliver interesting, independent content.</p>

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/08/16/on-charlottesville-va.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-08-16 20:07:08 &#43;0800">Aug 16, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am not an American, but my father and my siblings were born and lived in the USA. I have visited the country a number of times. I have spent time in Virginia, notably Lexington, which is about 70 miles away from Charlottesville, the town that has been tragically in the news this past week. While I don‚Äôt have the level of connection to the place that a United States citizen has, I do watch with interest and feel that I have at least some level of understanding of the American psyche.</p>

<p>From my perspective, what I saw in Charlottesville was a collection of white men who have been radicalised to the point of fanaticism and enabled by political leadership to intimidate and strike fear in others to their own ends. In a modern country it should never be reasonable for civilians to put on body armour and walk the streets with automatic machine guns. Carrying Nazi flags, performing Nazi salutes, and walking with burning torches<sup id="fnref-104-1"><a href="#fn-104-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup> echoes many sad and inglorious historical moments, from Hitler and WW2 to the KKK and acceptance of slavery (and the power imbalance in favour of white people that that confers).</p>

<p>I can only imagine what would have happened if non-white people had walked the streets similarly armed and garbed. I think there would have been an even more extreme response; which in itself highlights a level of underlying, unspoken racism that permeates the culture. I can&rsquo;t help but think that if roles were reversed, and it were black people carrying machine guns in the street, that it would be seen as an uprising. Based on recent US police behaviour it might also have been possible the police would have been willing to shoot to kill.</p>

<p>Next we have the horrible situation of a young man driving a car at speed into a laneway filled with people. Such behaviour cannot be condoned and the fact that some are attempting to mount excuses and justifications is frightening in itself, particularly if they believe their own professions. That was an act of terrorism, fuelled by hate, which i assume was itself fuelled by the fear of losing power and relevance in society. As far as I can tell, that man, and his equivalents, are fearful that their position in the world is being disrupted and their reactionary response is to imbibe hate and act with extreme prejudice.</p>

<p>As for the President, I am of the view that he has incited and encouraged this vein of hate, then turned a blind eye to the subsequent despicable actions of his acolytes. It took him three days to speak out against the actions (via a prepared speech), and then a day later he couldn‚Äôt live with that being his official position so he backtracked, showing his true colours. That he should be President of the USA is an entirely strange and sad situation.</p>

<p>A key reason (but not the root cause) for this uprising is said to be in honour and respect of General Lee, a man of regard for Southerners. Yet times change, and who we should and do venerate must also change. The problem is, enacting that change means rebalancing the power relationship amongst the citizens of the United States, and particularly the South. As a result those threatened most by such change<sup id="fnref-104-2"><a href="#fn-104-2" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup> and who are most at risk of &lsquo;losing&rsquo; as a result of any rebalancing are lashing out with extreme aggression in a sad and sorry attempt to maintain the status quo.</p>

<p>Change will happen. The clock cannot be turned back. Time and culture moves ever forward, even though this Charlottesville incident represents a step back. In the end I believe the tide of change will win out. I genuinely hope that tide brings equivalency to all citizens of the United States, irrespective of the colour of their skin, and that peace wins out.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/08/12/subscription-pricing-for.html">Subscription Pricing for Apps</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/08/12/subscription-pricing-for.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-08-12 22:31:56 &#43;0800">Aug 12, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The corner of the internet that I inhabit has been up in arms about yet another app, <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com/">Ulysses</a>, switching to a subscription-based pricing model. From the perspective of the developers trying to build a successful business this probably makes a lot of sense. The business analyst in me applauds them for finding an approach that will smooth revenue flows and help fund future development.</p>

<p>But changes like this can have unintended, or at least unforeseen, consequences. To my mind, the key question is how many users will switch over to this model? The developers may discover the addressable market shrinks considerably as their app will suddenly have a lot less appeal to hobbyists who are not earning revenue through their use of the app. They will probably sell subscriptions to authors and professional bloggers, but will that offset the losses? Did the developers truly understand the size of the market who would be willing to play for on-going use of the software?</p>

<h2>User Centricity</h2>

<p>I fear that developers are not taking a user-centric view to the subscription conundrum. Subscription revenue no doubt looks great in spreadsheet models with its recurring revenue. However, let&rsquo;s apply the &lsquo;job to be done&rsquo; approach to this issue, from the perspective of the end-user. I suggest that the job to be done is to provide a mechanism that will let me take notes that are ubiquitously available, and write occasional blog posts to be published to Wordpress. Boiled down further, the job to be done is text editing and organising.</p>

<p>So my choice is not to subscribe to Ulysses or not. My choices range from open source text editors, to Apple Notes, to a word processor, or an alternative subscription-based product. If I didn&rsquo;t want to blog, I could get by with a paper notebook and a pen.</p>

<p>It also creates a further issue in that it will reduce the likelihood that I will bounce between a number of apps. Up until now, I had decided to use Ulysses for blogging, Bear for notes, <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/">Scrivener</a> for work reports, and <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/">DEVONThink</a> for research and storage. I&rsquo;ve paid for all of these apps.</p>

<p>With subscriptions becoming more prevalent, I will have to reduce my app consumption because I don&rsquo;t want to be on the hook every month for apps that I may not use. I don&rsquo;t want to reduce my personal free cash flow by paying a swathe of subscriptions, particularly for apps that are essentially supporting a hobby that generates no income. I will become more selective in my software choice. My overall long-term expenditure on software may decline. If many users have the same opinion, then the overall market activity is going to decline. The outcome becomes worse for all developers.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, <em>unintended consequences</em>.</p>

<h2>My Choice</h2>

<p>This whole subscription brouhaha has led me to review my note-taking writing structure, and I&rsquo;ve decided to rely on another subscription app I pay for, <a href="bear-writer.com">Bear</a>. Those developers charge less for a very similar product, and they were up-front about the software being subscription-based from the outset. In my opinion, Bear has a nicer look and better reflects Markdown styles. The only thing I lose is direct-to-blog publishing. However, I can pretty easily copy or export text in Markdown or HTML, both of which can be directly pasted into the Wordpress CMS.</p>

<p>By choosing another subscription-based product, I demonstrate that I&rsquo;m not entirely against recurring costs. But if I can have one recurring cost rather than two, then I&rsquo;m all for that.</p>

<p>My situation is a real-world example of user-side app rationalisation that I think is likely to occur at scale, with the onset of subscription pricing.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Trying to run a business without useful and accurate performance information is like trying to drive a car without a speedometer. Sure, you will be able to guesstimate how fast you are going, and sometimes you‚Äôll even get it right. You might even get away with a bit of speeding! Most of the time though, you will be driving at the wrong speed. You will either not be taking full advantage of the car‚Äôs performance or you‚Äôll get a speeding ticket.</p>

<p>In a business sense, running a company without timely and accurate performance reporting may deliver occasional success, but it‚Äôs not a recipe for long-term sustainability.  A lack of insightful reports detailing costs, sales, productivity and profitability generated through effective data capture at the source is likely to result in a lack of insight about what is critical to the company‚Äôs success.</p>

<h2>Costs and Pricing</h2>

<p>Production costs and pricing can be deceptive. Clearly, a firm must ensure ensure that the price they charge the customer  accounts for the costs of the people and equipment directly involved in the production process. That price, however, also needs to have a sufficient margin attached to it such that it encompasses a share of all other cost overhead of the business, from rent and electricity, to paying for accounting and staff training. Furthermore, it has to incorporate a profit margin that will enable the business to retain some earnings for future investment and deliver a dividend to the investors/owners. Suddenly, the per unit price being charged needs to be much higher than may have initially been thought.</p>

<p>Without accurate information it can be easy to lose track of how effective this balance between price and cost is. Cross-subsidisation of profits across activities and products is another challenge. Soon enough, it can be almost impossible to understand what profit is being generated from each element of work. This can result in a situation occurring where both people and machinery are busy but the company loses money anyway. To avoid this frustrating eventuality, a business needs to ensure it is capturing and collating business information that will generate alerts at the time such a situation arises. Otherwise the problem will remain hidden and by the time it is discovered it will be too late to react with impact. Now the business is chasing its tail with the next piece of work not only having to cover all the standard costs but also make up for the losses incurred by the earlier work.</p>

<h2>Identify Issues at the Source</h2>

<p>If problems are only identified when complete revenue and expenditure figures are entered and aggregated within end of month financial reports, it is too late. Management needs to stay ahead of the game. A good manager needs to ensure that the business is capturing information throughout the production process, and that this information is able to deliver insights about the productivity, performance and profitability of its activities at any point in time.</p>

<p>Just as the job of a car‚Äôs speedometer is to provide real-time feedback, a business also needs to be able to read and react to its own (as close to) real-time performance. Without this structure the business is not being put in the best position to succeed, irrespective of any other activities underway.</p>

<p>Entropy is the loss of energy in a system to the point that it is no longer available for doing mechanical work. It is the reversion to mean; nature‚Äôs effort to return everything to stasis.</p>

<p>Entropy is occurring everywhere, all around us. It is a fact of our life. Companies are fighting entropy as well. Without concerted effort and capital being invested, and ensuring there is talent deployed throughout all levels of the business, the expectation is they will wither and die. People working within companies are also fighting their own entropic decline. Over time, people get bored, burnt out or generally lose interest in their job, which can lead to a decline in performance.</p>

<p>To fight entropy in business you need new inputs of energy. This can come from bringing new employees into the firm, who have new ideas and ways of thinking that can jolt the business and offer new opportunities. The business can find new products and markets and establish challenging goals to feed motivation and drive performance. Another option is investing in business improvement and better systems to automate work, thereby transferring the risk of entropy to machines and information technology, and away from individuals.</p>

<p>The laws of nature define that entropy cannot be defeated, but we as humans have become very adept at fighting it. Within companies, the fight against entropy also rages, and its the job of the board and management to set a direction and focus effort towards initiatives that will motivate the organisation to continue to battle to keep it at bay. The problem is that entropy is incessant. Companies need to continually guard against its debilitating effects, or suffer the inevitable consequence of decline.</p>

         	<p>In a further effort to establish <a href="http://andrewcanion.com">andrewcanion.com</a> as a genuinely useful resource for all things pertaining to me, I have now included <a href="http://andrewcanion.com/cv">a page dedicated to showcasing my curriculum vitae</a>.</p>

<p>I was looking at my current CV a few days ago which still exists as a Word document based upon a custom design I cooked up about 15 years ago. Since it&rsquo;s creation I&rsquo;ve just continued to add to and tweak the design rather than build a new document. This &lsquo;lazy man&rsquo; approach has been made easier by not actually moving jobs very often. Turns out, staying put has some advantages!</p>

<p>My CV, though, was an artefact of a paper-based era. I wanted to have something that was more dynamic, and a little more design-oriented that could offer some visual queues about the relevant stages of my career to date.</p>

<p>The de facto place for online CVs in the work world that I occupy is LinkedIn, so of course I keep <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewcanion/">my record of employment</a> there. It&rsquo;s where recruiters, acquaintances and stickybeakers all go to check out your professional bonafides. The cold hard truth is, however, that LinkedIn is just another social network funded by venture capital that is leveraging your information and privacy to sell advertising and &lsquo;premium&rsquo; memberships. So if I&rsquo;m promoting myself, I also want to be able to do that on a site which I own and control completely, and that isn&rsquo;t using my information to make money for others.</p>

<p>So the first version of my self-hosted CV is now online. I&rsquo;m sure I will continue to tweak and adjust it, but that&rsquo;s part of the fun. It&rsquo;s a resum√© and a creative outlet all rolled into one.</p>

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/06/29/day-one-goes.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-06-29 23:41:09 &#43;0800">Jun 29, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>So <a href="http://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> has become the next software application to adopt a subscription pricing model. This app developer has monkeyed around with its price/product offering for some time, and Day One has always been towards the expensive end of the curve for what could harshly be described as a glorified text editor. I guess it was inevitable they would ultimately end up converting to a subscription model in an effort to smooth revenue flow. Currently the developer is stating it will continue to support the current app and won&rsquo;t force a move to the subscription version, but there is no doubt the first foot has fallen. At some point, I&rsquo;m sure the other shoe will drop and it will be subscription or bust!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not against subscription-based business models for software. I pay subscription fees for YNAB, Setapp, 1Password, Fastmail, Headspace, and maybe some others. I am willing to pay for software that I use and enjoy, and that satisfies my own price/value decision matrix.</p>

<p>Day One&rsquo;s announced subscription seems expensive, especially when converted to Australian dollars. Expensive enough that rather than happily paying to carry on with an app I have used for more than 4 years, I am instead casting around for alternatives. The best and most immediate alternative I can see is to move my journaling to <a href="https://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a>. I&rsquo;ve found a <a href="https://www.workflow.is">Workflow</a>, ah, <em><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/8db9e0aa578a41c6b766c1a730b5b015">workflow</a></em> that auto-populates date, time and location into a neat header box so the journal entry has a basic level of context. What I would lose from Day One is the pretty and additional metadata and the journaling-specific user interface. Photo import can be replicated, albeit perhaps not quite as seamlessly. The major problem with Ulysses is that it just doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> like a journaling app - at least not yet. Maybe I would get used to it in that context with time?</p>

<p>As mentioned, I&rsquo;ve used Day One consistently for four years, and it has gained enough of a mental grip on me that I might miss it were I to migrate. Still, there is a limit to the number of subscriptions my budget can handle. When I have other, fully paid apps just waiting to be used, it becomes difficult to justify paying yet more money on an on-going basis.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m probably still on the fence right now, but Ulysses may be taking the lead&hellip;</p>

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/06/26/the-weekly-plan.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-06-26 11:07:20 &#43;0800">Jun 26, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I consider the two fundamental resources in work planning to be:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The calendar</li>
    <li>The to-do list</li>
</ol>

<p>The calendar represents the hard landscape: events that are non-negotiable, time-based and require you to be doing a certain thing, at a certain time, at a certain place, possibly with another certain person. If it&rsquo;s in the calendar, it&rsquo;s a <em>certainty</em>. Calendar entries are commitments to yourself and possibly others.</p>

<p>The to-do list is used to track tasks needed to be done to move the ball forward. The list is potentially filled with a lot of items that may not necessarily be linked with one another. They are commitments to yourself, but they are not tied to being done at a particular time and don‚Äôt generally require the involvement of others. I use <a href="http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/05/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> for managing my task list, but it really doesn&rsquo;t matter what is used, as long as there is a trusted location to track everything to be done.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I‚Äôm not a fan of putting tasks onto calendars. I think they are two distinctly different things that should exist in their own dedicated spaces. However, like any good rule, there are times when this rule should be broken.</p>

<h2>Leveraging multiple calendars</h2>

<p>The beauty of using modern electronic calendar systems is they support multiple calendars. The classic and most obvious application of this is creating seperate <em>work</em> and <em>home</em> calendars. In addition to these staples, however, it can be helpful to create a <em>weekly plan</em> calendar.</p>

<p>Each calendar&rsquo;s visibility can be toggled on and off, depending on the needs of the moment.</p>

<p>Using the <em>weekly plan</em> calendar can facilitate the addition of tasks onto a calendar view without gunking up your regular calendars that represent real physical events and commitments. This leads to the next step: time blocking and setting commitments for your future self.</p>

<h2>Time blocking</h2>

<p>The purpose of time blocking is to help establish a plan for a forthcoming period of time and build accountability for your time. The idea is to create work sessions that are linked directly to items on your task list. Transferring tasks to a calendar and applying estimated timeframes in the form of a timed calendar entry can help build a visual map of work to be done. Visualisation is a great tool to help identify whether your to-do list is realistically achievable in the time available. It can also help enforce urgency by indicating how potentially little time is available for meaningful work. Finally, it can be a reward system. If you get ahead of your schedule, you&rsquo;ve earned yourself some relaxation time, safe in the knowledge that you aren&rsquo;t falling behind!</p>

<h2>My approach</h2>

<p>I generally reserve the time blocking approach for when I have a lot going on, and I&rsquo;m starting to feel overwhelmed by it all. Ideally, at the start of the work week I will set aside half an hour, and look at my calendar of commitments. These are the scheduled events with other people that are locked in (usually weeks in advance) and that I need to fit all my other work around.</p>

<p>The next step is identifying the tasks that represent the &lsquo;big rocks&rsquo; that I need to progress. What projects need to move forward this week? What are the tasks that need large sessions of time to get into a flow?<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Once I understand what time slots I have available for task-based work, I start creating related events on my <em>weekly plan</em> calendar, filling my days more completely. I need to take some care here though. I&rsquo;m not an automaton, so it is important not to schedule every last minute of time. Doing that is just setting myself up to fail. In any week, unexpected things are bound to arise and time will be needed for this stuff, in addition to the general administrative tasks of email, communications, management issues, and so on.</p>

<p>With the weekly plan calendar populated and tessellated with my other calendars, I end up with a clear picture of my work week. At any point of time I know what I can and should be working on. I know that if I stick to the plan I set for myself, I will be closer to my goals at the end of the week than I was at the beginning. It&rsquo;s a practical approach to personal accountability.</p>

<p>The overhead of doing this planning is not always worth the effort, but when lots is happening and it feels like control is being lost, this is a great way to reassert your plans and ensure that the important is not being overwhelmed by the urgent.</p>

    <li id="fn1">Writing is a great example of this - you can't really do it for 30 minutes here and there; you need a solid chunk of several hours. <a href="#ffn1">&#8617;</a></li>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In the aftermath of Apple&rsquo;s WWDC conference and an almost unprecedented number of new pieces of hardware have been released at what is theoretically a software development conference, I get to do some imaginary shopping.</p>

<p>For the past 18 months, Apple&rsquo;s hardware lineup has been so out of date (except for iPhone, of course) that I&rsquo;ve not even wanted to buy anything with imaginary money. They&rsquo;ve righted the ship now, but in doing so are almost listing to the other side. Now it&rsquo;s so difficult to identify the perfect device, I&rsquo;m paralysed by choice.<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2>macOS</h2>

<p>With regard to the Mac lineup, the 5K iMacs with P3 panels and Kaby Lake processors represent the first time I&rsquo;ve been tempted by a desktop computer in about a decade. Combining this with extended iPad use as a mobile platform could actually work, come iOS 11.</p>

<p>But laptops are still the most flexible option. The MacBook (Adorable) is becoming competitive and is so diminutive, but it is still hamstrung by having a single port and when stacking price against performance, perhaps a MacBook Pro is the better option. The MacBook (Escape) is probably the pick here. Touchbar seems like a dead end that the market nor developers are excited by. Yet only the Touchbar models have TouchID which is a useful feature.</p>

<p>So, in terms of macOS, the most sensible use for my imaginary money is to keep it in my pocket and instead wander over to the iOS table, and see if this is an easier decision. My existing 2013 MacBook Pro has a few more years left in it, anyway.</p>

<h2>iOS</h2>

<p>This is the Apple cash cow platform, so what have they got to sell me? In terms of iPhones, I&rsquo;m not even looking. Work provides me with an iPhone SE which is a form factor I quite like for basic tasks, and I&rsquo;m not about to absorb another phone contract. Anyway, this is not an iPhone release event, so let&rsquo;s move to iPad.</p>

<h3>iPad</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a believer in iPad since it was released and I put in my pre-order as soon as the online store switched to pre-sale. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to upgrade my iPad Air, and the first compelling reason to do that was the iPad Pro 12.9&rdquo; (1st gen). But then the iPad Pro 9.7&rdquo; was released and everything got out of sync with what model had what features. I knew the sensible thing to do was wait for the next revision.</p>

<p>My waiting has paid off, because these are the devices I&rsquo;ve dreamed of. Beautiful 120Hz ProMotion displays, accelerated Pencil sampling and come iOS 11, proper support for multitasking. Yes, I want one! But which one? The 10.5&rdquo; looks to be everything I could want, until I realise it doesn&rsquo;t support two full screen iPad apps side-by-side. One of them has to use the iPhone view controller. That does not fit with my productivity needs.</p>

<p>So it looks like it falls to the iPad Pro 12.9 (2nd gen). This has all the power I want, but I will be trading off couch comfort. Where is my Goldilocks iPad?!</p>

<h2>Missing the four quadrant product matrix</h2>

<p>When Steve Jobs returned to Apple and started its turnaround, one of the first things he did was rationalise the product line down to a four quadrant matrix. It was simple: on one axis, professional<em>consumer, on the other axis, laptop</em>desktop. Here was enough breathing room between each of the specs and the prices of these machines that it became quite easy to choose which was for you.</p>

<p>Now, as Apple&rsquo;s product line expands, they have a much larger matrix. This has resulted in overlaps across price, capability and function. Is the iPad a suitable laptop replacement; or is a laptop a necessary complement to an iPhone?</p>

<p>With my imaginary money, I think my decision is to keep my MacBook Pro and replace my ageing iPad Air with an iPad Pro 12.9&rdquo;. That should be enough to keep me going for the next year or two, at which point solving the computer problem will be a more pressing problem which I hope, by that time, has a more apparent solution.</p>

         	<p>A good tradesman values his tools, and generally has a preference for one piece of equipment over another.</p>

<p>In my trade, the computer I use is my primary tool. My tool of choice is a Mac. I am able to be so much more productive on a Mac because it‚Äôs the tool I know inside out. Over years I have customised how the operating system works, added on various tools, and generally made it work even better for me than it does out of the box.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in my organisation Windows remains king. My employer doesn‚Äôt have a formalised Bring Your Own Device policy, but at least in recent years they have made WiFi available for staff, although it is firewalled from the main networks.</p>

<h2>Corporate IT versus innovation</h2>

<p>Employees are assigned Windows-based equipment to staff, and only company-issued hardware is supported by IT. Only their Windows devices are able to connect and authenticate directly with the official network. These devices are also completely locked down so the user cannot install or customise these platforms to suit their own needs or abilities. This is based on the assumption that a worker will only ever want Microsoft Office, and the overriding preference for corporate IT to make their job easier.</p>

<p>I think this approach stifles of innovation. The use of applications that go beyond Office can allow for employees to discover more creative solutions to problems. If the only tool you have is Word/Excel/Powerpoint, then every problem has to be resolved in the same limited way. Yet I love mind-mapping with <a href="https://www.toketaware.com">iThoughts</a>, then using OPML to move the concepts between a map and an outline in <a href="http://omnigroup.com/omnioutliner">OmniOutliner</a>. I am faster using <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a> than the Mac‚Äôs Finder (and infinitely quicker than using Windows Explorer!). I have <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a><sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com">Hazel</a> managing the system and moving files and folders around automatically on my behalf. I write long-form business reports in <a href="http://literatureandlatte.com">Scrivener</a>. Then, I can use all the hooks across the Apple ecosystem to establish synchronicity with an iPad <sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. All of this customisations represents innovation that makes me more efficient, but all of it is in circumvention of corporate IT. If I limited myself to a Windows PC I would be worse at my job. I wouldn‚Äôt be happy if my carpenter was forced to use a junky Ozito saw for all his work, and I don‚Äôt see why knowledge workers are so often limited in the same way.</p>

<h2>Firms need to move with the times</h2>

<p>With the move to more cloud services, firms have the opportunity to release the reins on device management. Establishing and supporting a Bring Your Own Device policy becomes much easier when the device simply becomes a node connecting to cloud storage, email, and so on. If a company doesn‚Äôt support an employee‚Äôs efforts to expand their creativity and efficiency, they are likely to lose their most productive and creative people.</p>

<p>Also, consider the next generation of workers that have been brought up on phones running mobile operating systems. If a business doesn‚Äôt effectively support a multi-device, syncing approach, they may find that younger workers truly struggle to manage.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/06/12/personal-kanban.html">Personal Kanban</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2017/06/12/personal-kanban.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-06-12 12:27:32 &#43;0800">Jun 12, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><h2>What is Kanban?</h2>
Traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board">Kanban boards</a> are used in manufacturing and other production environments to help visualise the flow of work and bring to attention any potential backlogs or other issues that might impact upon efficiency or productivity. When I travelled to Japan a few years ago as part of a study tour on lean manufacturing, I witnessed all sorts of kanban boards in operation to help provide factories with necessary production information.</p>

<p>The essential premise of a kanban board is to demonstrate the flow of work along the value chain of production. At the fundamental level, the kanban board starts with a column for ‚Äòwork to be done‚Äô, then one for ‚Äòwork in progress‚Äô, before the work task exits the value chain as ‚Äòcompleted‚Äô work. Visually, a simple kanban board will have these elements drawn as columns on a whiteboard with a series of sticky notes representative of each element of work. As the work progresses, the sticky note is physically moved along the kanban board.</p>

<p>Kanban boards can be used more broadly than in just manufacturing environments. More recently, software development has adopted many of the processes and tools of lean manufacturing, including kanban boards, in the design and implementation of agile, scrum and other team-based development methodologies.
<h2>Personal Kanban</h2>
I have an interest in kanban at a more atomic level - that is, how can the use of kanban boards help an individual to understand and visualise their own personal workflow. For knowledge work, understanding where somebody is at with work projects and having a grasp as to whether the situation is under control, or at risk, can be hard.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve recently been reviewing my own productivity management system to see if I can better implement personal kanban myself, to help me understand just how much work I have at any one time, and how my own ‚Äòbacklog‚Äô is looking.
<h2>My Technical Implementation</h2>
I <a href="http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/05/omnifocus/">previously wrote about OmniFocus</a> and how that brilliant application keeps me on track. Into that I have now created some kanban contexts, and tied these to a kanban perspective.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_52&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;214&rdquo;]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" src="http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/723c520851.jpg" alt="My OmniFocus kanban contexts" width="214" height="214" /> My OmniFocus kanban contexts[/caption]</p>

<p>This helps me work on my task list by seeing my backlog of items, seeing what is currently active, and being able to work on them to completion.</p>

<p>While OmniFocus is excellent, one of its key weaknesses is reporting and data presentation. It helps manage work brilliantly, but it doesn‚Äôt do so well at providing context. Not a management report is to be seen, other than being able to create any combination of list.</p>

<p>To help with visualisation, I‚Äôve had to turn elsewhere. I have recently revised a few <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> boards that I use to help visualise my workflow, simplifying the board design and ensuring there was a very clear ‚Äòleft to right‚Äô flow. In the process of updating Trello, I investigated a few other online kanban boards (namely Kanban Tool and LeanKit) to ensure there wasn‚Äôt a better option for me, but the best experience remains Trello.</p>

<p>My final step was to really nerd out by leveraging the hard work of <a href="http://1klb.com/about/">Jan-Yves Ruzicka</a> who has built a Ruby library called <a href="http://1klb.com/tags/omniboard/">Omniboard</a>. If you have the capability to install Ruby, and the MacOS developer tools, Omniboard can create a fantastic graphical presentation of your OmniFocus data. This is output as a single, stand-alone HTML file which can be saved to Dropbox and thereby made accessible from any device at any location.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_51&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;1163&rdquo;]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51" src="http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/5576e5924d.jpg" alt="OmniFocus data presented in Omniboard" width="1163" height="1144" /> OmniFocus data presented in Omniboard[/caption]</p>

<p>To fully automate the process, my final task was to have Keyboard Maestro executes a shell command to update the Omniboard file on a regular basis. This ensures I have a regularly updated personal kanban board based on the activity and progress I have recorded in OmniFocus.
<h2>The Point Being?</h2>
The ultimate outcome of all this tinkering is that I now have:
<ol>
    <li>a tactical view of my to-do list in OmniFocus;</li>
    <li>a visual representation of my workflow in Omniboard; and</li>
    <li>independent high-level strategic kanban boards operating separately in Trello.</li>
</ol>
If clarity of information is important to managing workloads, then I am now in a much better place than before implementing these changes. You may not wish to go this deeply down the rabbit hole, but I have found it any interesting exercise in designing a workflow system that not only helps me get stuff done, but let‚Äôs me see how much capacity I have to get more stuff done.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I‚Äôve always been a money tracker. I still have ledger books from when I was 14 years old, with my handwriting tracking my money in and out. I would reconcile it to my bank savings account with little ticks.</p>

<p>I think I learned this habit watching my Mom as she would carefully manage the family finances at the kitchen table.<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>¬†There was never enough money to go around (not that I was aware of that at the time), so much of my Mom‚Äôs job was timing cheque payments, deferring bills, and calculating how much, if any, might be left over for the week. Such was life for a divorced mother of four living on not much more than a pension and without any support from her former husband and father of the aforementioned children.<sup><a id="ffn2" class="footnote" href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>As I grew and got my first part-time job, my money-tracking ways continued. Each week I would record my income, and understand how much money I had available to get me through to the next week.</p>

<p>I got a bit older, graduated university and got a real job. By this point I had graduated to electronic money tracking. For a short while I used Microsoft Money, before settling on Quicken and using it for years. Each year, they would release a mediocre upgrade and I would pay the license fee to keep using it. Year after year that software got worse.</p>

<p>I got married and we took a traditional approach to finance by merging our money. What was mine was hers, and what was hers was mine. Fortunately, my money tracking addiction could continue since while my wife is financially aware, she didn‚Äôt have a compelling urge to record and reconcile the way I did!</p>

<p>Eventually Quicken became so terrible that I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to pay for it anymore. This was a dark time. There was no compelling software to adopt so I rolled my own Excel spreadsheet and used that. This was probably the first time since my ledger books that I wasn‚Äôt recording transactions. Instead, I tried to take a high-level approach by using a budgeting/forecasting model. It felt like it was working at the time but in hindsight we fell into a bit of a financial hole without realising it. We were relying on future income to cover past expenditure - what is referred to as ‚Äòriding the credit card float‚Äô.</p>

<p>About 3 years ago, I realised that my carefully managed spreadsheet was busy work that was actually not helping us meet our goals. I did another software review and this time I found the application that changed everything: <a title="YNAB" href="https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=omvgckrfFThsnI3X&amp;utm_source=customer_referral">YNAB</a> (short for You Need a Budget). YNAB took me back to my roots. It required transaction monitoring and was backed by a ledger that needed to be reconciled. But the magic trick of YNAB is that first and foremost, it is a budgeting system. As much as I had tracked money for all those years, and generated my income and expenditure reports, it was always backwards looking. I was auditing what had already happened, but not making commitments about what my money should do in the future. YNAB completely changed my perspective on personal finance management.</p>

<p>YNAB is all about giving jobs to the money you have on hand <em>right now</em>. You budget that available cash down to zero, then stop. You don‚Äôt live on the credit card float. You don‚Äôt plan to spend more than you have. You allocate the money to a series of planned expenditures, and then track progress against that. If you overspend you get immediate feedback and can adjust your budget through reallocation - as YNAB says, you ‚Äòroll with the punches‚Äô.</p>

<p>While this seems like short-term budgeting, it actually facilitates long-term goal realisation. You suddenly realise how finite your cash supply is, especially after accounting for those recurring bills and putting money aside for the big annual bills<sup><a id="ffn3" class="footnote" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>. With the little amounts that are left over after setting money aside for the necessities, you can make some hard decisions about what you want to do with that discretionary cash.</p>

<p>Since using YNAB we have never been in a more solid financial position. We can pay all our bills as and when they fall due (even the big ones). We can save and invest for our family‚Äôs future. We can set aside money for fun.</p>

<p>The best thing of all, though, is that we <strong>do not</strong> fight about money. We have no nagging money stress between us. We share our income, we share our expenses, and we share our savings goals and spending intentions.</p>

<p>After having managed my money very carefully for almost 30 years, this is the best it‚Äôs ever been. I endorse YNAB wholeheartedly. <a href="https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=omvgckrfFThsnI3X&amp;utm_source=customer_referral">Get it</a>, use it, love it!

         	<p>I was one of the first on the Gmail bandwagon. Back when the only way to get an account on the service was to receive an invitation code from somebody else already using it. I remember desperately asking around my networks, until I finally found somebody who was able to supply me with a code - I was in!<br /><br />Having an @gmail.com address was a point of pride. You were a cool kid with a cool email address, and not one of those sad hotmailers, embarrassing yahooligans, or a joker advertising your local ISP. Using Gmail was also transformational. It was probably the first web app that was genuinely better than desktop software. It was fast, had quick keyboard shortcuts, huge storage (1Gb at launch!), and of course your email archive gained the power of Google search.<br /><br />Times were good. Google kept adding features, making the service better. It added storage so you really could just <i>archive</i> email. But over time, Gmail began to acquire cruft. It became less efficient and it started to frustrate me. The tagging system impacted IMAP compatibility and caused annoyances syncing with local mail clients.<br /><br />The most frustrating aspect for me was it&rsquo;s half-hearted approach to supporting custom domain names. Early on, it seemed as though Gmail were onboard with people using custom domains. As time passed though, the business imperative took over and they shifted full custom domain support to their GSuite paid service. So my @andrewcanion email would generally reveal its true Gmail nature, which annoyed me.<br /><br />A couple of months ago, I decided enough was enough. It was time for a change. I wanted to find an email service that supported custom domains, that would support proper IMAP, offer push email, that would respect my privacy and not sell advertising based on my email, and be a reliable and <i>good</i> service. All of this necessitates payment, and at this stage of my life, I&rsquo;m okay with that.<br /><br />After reviewing a few options, including GSuite, Office 365, Zoho and Rackspace, I ultimately chose <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=17095336">Fastmail</a>. Their service ticked all the boxes and offered one extra bonus - they are an Australian company. So I could buy local (albeit in US dollars).<br /><br />So far, the service has been brilliant. Their web app is great, their documentation brilliant, and their customer service quick and accessible. It&rsquo;s amazing how much better a service can be when you are a real, paying customer.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m at the point now where I actually want <i>more</i> email! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever said that before.<br /><br />If you are looking to upgrade your email experience, I highly commend Fastmail. If you use my <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=17095336">referral code</a> to sign up, you also get a discount. I am sure you will not be disappointed.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have a vision of myself without the support of <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>. I‚Äôd be wandering around in a semi-permanent state of confusion, wondering what the heck I should be doing with my time and trying to keep all the ‚Äòto-do‚Äôs‚Äô of my life active and remembered in my brain. The stress of it all would be horrible!</p>

<p>Instead, I have OmniFocus. This application acts as my external brain, keeping all my various projects and tasks ordered, across all my areas of responsibility. It syncs across my Mac, iPhone and iPad so that I can know what I should (and can) do at any point in time. It keeps me on track with my work, bringing up tasks to do at the right time, and keeping them out of my sight when there‚Äôs nothing I can do to move the project forward.</p>

<p>I have been on the OmniFocus bandwagon for years, but I‚Äôve been on the <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù</a> bandwagon for even longer. I think I started using that way of managing my work in about 2003. Now, I can‚Äôt imagine working, living or thinking about my stuff to be done in any other way.</p>

<p>I have been an active user of OmniFocus since before it was OmniFocus, and was instead just a user-generated add-on for OmniOutliner. The app is just so fantastic to use. Of course, it does have it‚Äôs foibles, and the biggest problem is aligned with the biggest problem of GTD in general these days, which is ubiquitous <em>context</em>. When GTD was developed, you went to your office to handle paperwork, and your computer desk to ‚Äòdo email‚Äô. Smartphones hadn‚Äôt been invented and if you wanted to sync data, it probably involved a serial cable between your computer and your Palm Pilot.</p>

<p>This created physical barriers that prevented you from doing stuff, which the methodology termed <em>context</em>. (Un)fortunately, now we can pretty much do anything anywhere, rendering the concept of context almost obsolete. While people have tried to use other axes such as <em>energy</em> or <em>mindset</em>, there‚Äôs nothing as good as the essentially redundant physical context. OmniFocus, for better or worse, continues to cling to that context mode.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, that can be worked around, and it still offers a fantastic view of your life in task form. Look at what‚Äôs urgent, look at what you can do now, look at what you are waiting on to be able to progress - it can slice and dice your tasks in any way you need.</p>

<p>I couldn‚Äôt live without it. I don‚Äôt want to live without it. I don‚Äôt want to have to keep all my thoughts juggled in my head - that‚Äôs crazy! My brain is for value-adding, not remembering stuff!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Following on from my thoughts about Setapp, and now having all this extra software choice in my life, is that I now have to confront the challenge of choice.<br /><br />For <em>many, many</em>, years I have been using <a href="http://omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> to manage my life - keeping all my work and personal projects and tasks safe and sound. I was using OmniFocus before it was even an app - back when it was a series of OmniOutliner scripts put together by <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com">Ethan Schoonover</a> to replicate this magical GTD (Getting Things Done) philosophy that had entered the world not all that long before. So I&#8217;ve got a long-term relationship with OmniFocus. I love it. But as with any relationships, there are hurdles and things that you really wish were different. I wish OmniFocus had graphical elements, like visual timelines and kanban boards. I wish it had better abilities as an information/document manager. I wish it would move away from the arcane view of &#8216;contexts&#8217; which in this modern, connected, mobile world are not nearly as useful as they were in David Allen&#8217;s 2001 world where he could walk to the park and suddenly not be able to answer email.<br /><br />So, Setapp has some alternative apps. One in particular, <a href="http://www.pagico.com">Pagico</a>, looks nice. It has some interesting file management concepts. It has a visual timeline. Maybe I could get to like this? But, hang on, I have a decade of history with OmniFocus. The switching cost - not in dollars - but in time and effort is huge. OmniFocus has inertia, muscle memory and comfort in its favour. How can Pagico compete with that? So I&#8217;ve tried using Pagico, and it looks pretty on the surface. But underneath it feels a bit&#8230; <em>brittle</em>. The sync engine is weird and the mobile apps feel pretty terrible anyway. The interface seems slow. I am struggling to trust the app.<br /><br />Maybe I should just stick with OmniFocus&#8230;<br /><br />Okay, so let&#8217;s go with another choice. I&#8217;ve used Scrivener for many years and more recently have been using it heavily as the starting point for the report writing I have to do for my work, before it is transferred into a CMS or Word file. I like Scrivener, but it is big and heavy for what I need. So now, with Setapp, I have <a href="http://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a>. This is an app that I&#8217;ve followed but not ever felt compelled to buy since I had Scrivener already. Now, though, I can give it a chance.<br /><br />So I have to learn a new app, remember to always write in Markdown, and then hope that I can easily get the text <em>out</em> of Ulysses in a format that I can use it in for its final form. Yes, Markdown is great but bureaucratic government systems don&#8217;t grok it, okay?<br /><br />So I&#8217;ve got to deal with another app choice, and now potentially have my stuff spread across two different word processors. But, of course, I&#8217;ve built an ecosystem around Scrivener across macOS and iOS - but Setapp only gives me the macOS version of Ulysses.<br /><br />The list goes on, and I guess this is capitalism at its finest. There is never <em>the</em> tool to use. Wherever a successful product is built, others quickly join the party. This is not something that is limited to software - this happens throughout the economy. Some of these apps are really good, and some come with their own idiosyncrasies. My challenge is to decide which of all the flawed products, speaks most to me. Which of these apps has been designed most in the way that my brain works, and which have flaws that least often affect me? This is the challenge of choice. I think I might just need to look on the bright side, and realise that this is all just grist for the mill of a software tinkerer, indulging his hobby.</p>

         	<p>Tonight I installed <a href="http://setapp.com">Setapp</a> on my Mac. This service provides a wide range of full version software in exchange for US$9.99 per month. There is no escape from software as a service, and I appreciate the challenge that software developers face trying to earn an income and support a living with the old &ldquo;full version plus upgrades&rdquo; pricing model.<br /><br />A couple of the applications in the Setapp bundle I have been eyeing off for a while; some I have wanted but not enough to pay for; and some I&rsquo;ve no use for. The only downside is that many of the &lsquo;highlight&rsquo; apps I have previously bought independently, so I&rsquo;m missing the good deal on those ones.<br /><br />I admire <a href="http://macpaw.com">MacPaw</a> for having the idea and the temerity to build this kind of store, and to attract a wide range of developers into it. I wish everybody involved the best of luck. Apple&rsquo;s own Mac App Store is a cesspit of garbage apps (and sandboxing restrictions) that has never really worked for me, or it seems, quality developers. Perhaps Setapp can be subscription software done right.<br /><br />If you&rsquo;d like to sign up to Setapp yourself and give this service a try, I&rsquo;d be much obliged if you did so using my Setapp <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/mxocq3b5">referral link</a>.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Many years ago I started a <a href="https://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> blog when the web was young, and doing such things was hard.<br /><br />Then a young upstart named <a href="https://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> arrived, and I couldn&rsquo;t resist its modern design and dynamic database structure. I transitioned, and spent hours monkeying with CSS to get things looking <em>just right</em>.<br /><br />Then the web became social, and I gave up on blogs. The big shift was to micro-updates and photoblogs and pseudo-conversations through Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, respectively.<br /><br />Gradually, the web became corporatised around these big brands.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I was still loyal to reading blogs through RSS feeds and my <a href="feedwrangler.net">Feedwrangler</a> account (val&eacute; Google Reader). These blogs were where I got my web nutrition, not the vacuous Facebook shares and fleeting Twitter exchanges. Blogs belonged to people. They were hosted at personal domains and the work was their own. I used to be one of those people.<br /><br />Time has moved on, and Movable Type and Wordpress are still out there, but I don&rsquo;t have the time to invest like I used to, nor the interest to dig in, nor the will and desire to set up on a large-scale web host. So I am trialling a new approach. This time, using RapidWeaver and its very simple blog module. It seems too simple. It seems like I will find myself frustrated by its &lsquo;simple&rsquo; approach. But that is probably all I need. I don&rsquo;t intend to blog every day. I don&rsquo;t even expect to have a readership.<br /><br />This is just a hobby for me; a rekindling of something I used to do when I was younger, and when time was more available.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s see how we go.<br /></p>
