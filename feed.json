Many of my friends are Android users, so I end up having to rely on WhatsApp. Even my attempts to transition them to Telegram or Signal failed.\n- That's a kick ass wheelchair that lady owns.\n- No new maps for me In Australia.\n\n## iPadOS\n\n- Sidebars - like a Mac!\n- Search on the iPad seems like LaunchBar on the Mac, but it will probably be more like Spotlight, that is, not quite as good. \n- The new Pencil and *Scribble* feature looks great\n\n## Apple Watch & AppleTV\n\n- The scientific capability in Apple is incredible; the resources they can plough into movement sensing for exercise, surround sound, etc. is crazy.\n\n## Home\n\n- Yes! Adaptive lighting. I've got some LifX bulbs and that app has dawn/dusk settings, but this looks way better.\n- Is it time for me to get some security video cameras for the house? Whcih ones are best and most future proof?\n\n## macOS\n\n- Apple have done translucent menu bars before. I still don't like them.\n- The spaced out menus are ugly. \n- I wish I had friends who lived this perfect Apple experience of sharing ETAs with me, sending memojies, etc. It doesn't happen in my world.\n- I've been trialling a bunch of different browsers over the past week. Safari might win me back just in time.\n\n## Apple Silicon\n- Of course it's not called *ARM Macs*.\n- Apple have built a hell of a competitive moat with Apple Silicon.\n- Talk of Linux virtualisation but not Windows. I reckon that must be gone.\n",

As a long-time fan of <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a> and a light user of their Basecamp Personal<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup> product I was interested to see how they were going to address the issue of email.</p>\n\n<p>First off, Hey looks beautiful. Beyond looks it has a number of interesting features to support a healthier and more efficient email workflow.</p>\n\n<p>Hey is a subscription service and I have no issue with this whatsoever. I already pay for email services, preferring to be a customer of an email service provider, rather than the product itself<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">3</a></sup>. I&rsquo;m a happy user of <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.com/\">Fastmail</a> which I use in conjunction with <a href=\"https://www.sanebox.com/signup/e46d56be53/c\">SaneBox</a>, <a href=\"https://freron.com/\">MailMate</a> on my iMac, and <a href=\"https://preside.io/\">Preside</a> on iOS.</p>\n\n<p>For my purposes then, I&rsquo;m not looking for an email service that will allow me to migrate away from a free-of-charge provider.</p>\n\n<p>Herein lies the problem, at least in terms of me being a customer of Hey. Hey is a standalone service. Unlike a typical email provider it doesn&rsquo;t expose an IMAP interface which other apps can use. If it did this, it would probably lose all the pretty add-ons they have built into the system. Furthermore it doesn&rsquo;t allow the use of a custom domain. You get a nice <code>@hey.com</code> email address but you can&rsquo;t BYO a domain name. A key part of my email infrastructure is owning my domain and emails form a component of that. Moving to Hey would mean stepping away from that lovely setup. I like owning <code>@andrewcanion.com</code> and <code>@canion.me</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons I quickly ascertained that Hey was not a product for me.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that it doesn&rsquo;t have some clever workflows, and it does look pretty. I can&rsquo;t replicate the pretty, but in watching the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI\">walkthrough demo by Jason Fried</a> I was fairly certain I could replicate most of the functionality.</p>\n\n<p>So to satisfy my own curiosity I worked with the products I already have - SaneBox and MailMate - to see if I could construct a Hey-style workflow.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s step through the way I built my copy-cat workflow.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"triage-yes-or-no\">Triage - Yes or No</h2>\n\n<p>Hey lets you select whether new users will be added to your inbox (they call it an &ldquo;Imbox&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not going there).</p>\n\n<p>I use SaneBox for this instead. It does the same sort of triage, using machine learning to determine whether a sender is important to you or not. If it thinks they are, it goes to your inbox. If not, it goes to an alternative &ldquo;SaneLater&rdquo; folder.</p>\n\n<p>I have enabled notifications only for email that lands in my Inbox, so that matches the &lsquo;quiet by design&rsquo; feature of Hey.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"focus-reply\">Focus &amp; Reply</h2>\n\n<p>Within Hey, this is a neat bundle of messages that are tagged to be dealt with later, most ideally in a focused session of email. They sit as a little visual stack at the bottom of the window. I can&rsquo;t match the visuals, but I should be able to match the functionality with MailMate.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve created a new Smart Mailbox, named <code>Focus &amp; Reply</code> that looks across All Messages, and filters as per these conditions:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/e34350c219.png\" alt=\"Focus reply\" title=\"focus_reply.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"211\" /></p>\n\n<p>Note the <code>keyword</code> designation. MailMate lets you apply keywords to any email. To make this easier, I&rsquo;ve added a keywords toolbar to MailMate, and have it set to showing the two that are relevant to the Hey-style workflow. I have a magnifying glass for Focus &amp; Reply, and a pushpin for Set Aside.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/b80bedc99b.png\" alt=\"Tags toolbar\" title=\"tags_toolbar.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"110\" height=\"33\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now, if I click the icon on any email thread, it is tagged accordingly. I&rsquo;ve enabled a column to show the keywords, so an email might look like this - note the magnifying glass:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/cd3f94a454.png\" alt=\"Tag column\" title=\"tag_column.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"295\" height=\"22\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now only emails that I&rsquo;ve tagged by clicking the magnifying glass will appear in the Focus &amp; Reply smart mailbox.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"set-aside\">Set Aside</h2>\n\n<p>In Hey, Set Aside is designated for mail that you want to reference later. These emails are also taken away from the Inbox view.</p>\n\n<p>As with Focus &amp; Reply, I&rsquo;ve set the pushpin tag to act as the determinant. Together with another Smart Search, I&rsquo;ve got this group of emails configured as such:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/3c4bec0713.png\" alt=\"Set aside\" title=\"set_aside.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"211\" /></p>\n\n<p>But to get the workflow where these are &lsquo;out of view&rsquo; in my regular Inbox, I need to configure my Inbox view as well. So I&rsquo;ve created an <code>Unread Inbox</code>, that works on a series of mailboxes and applies a condition to only show unread mail, as such:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/94d2368ef4.png\" alt=\"Unread inbox\" title=\"unread_inbox.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"211\" /></p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/981abea5d7.png\" alt=\"Unread inbox conditions\" title=\"unread_inbox_conditions.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"211\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now if I want to reference my Set Aside email, I can click the relevant Mailbox in the Sidebar.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/1ccb39ad53.png\" alt=\"Mailmate sidebar\" title=\"mailmate_sidebar.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"185\" height=\"260\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-feed\">The Feed</h2>\n\n<p>Hey uses a concept of The Feed almost like a social media scroll of email incorporating newsletters, advisories and all the other non-timely information we get via email.</p>\n\n<p>I created this with the help of SaneBox. All my <code>The Feed</code> smart folder does is show me the contents of the default SaneBox <code>SaneNews</code> folder. It generally knows what should go in there, and I can train it as I go simply by moving mail into that folder as I see fit.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"paper-trail\">Paper Trail</h2>\n\n<p>The Paper Trail in Hey is for receipts, invoices, and other such transactional information.</p>\n\n<p>Here, I created a custom SaneBox folder to replicate this feature. As I get receipts and things, I will move a few into this email folder and SaneBox will quickly learn and take care of them for me in the future.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-email\">Other Email</h3>\n\n<p>For now, I&rsquo;m still using the <code>SaneLater</code> mail folder to catch other less-important email. Looking at Hey, it seems email can only go to the Inbox, The Feed or The Paper Trail.</p>\n\n<p>So for now, I&rsquo;ve either got more features, or more confusion. Yet to be determined which that is.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"people-pages\">People Pages</h2>\n\n<p>Hey has a concept of people pages where you can see everything that relates to a single individual.</p>\n\n<p>MailMate has me covered quite well here although it doesn&rsquo;t look as pretty as what Hey has achieved.</p>\n\n<p>You will note from the image of my MailMate sidebar above that I have a <code>People Pages</code> folder. When I expand that, MailMate shows me a folder for each individual sender. Click any of those and only email from that person shows in the main window. The image below shows this, with disguised names for privacy reasons.</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/3e068fc0f6.png\" alt=\"People sidebar\" title=\"people_sidebar.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"168\" height=\"265\" /></p>\n\n<p>With that, I&rsquo;ve got a focused view of each person as well.</p>\n\n<p><em>2020-06-17: I have created <a href=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2020/06/17/addendum-replicating-heycom.html\">an addendum to this post</a>, providing some more detail as to how to create the People Pages smart mailbox.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"attachments\">Attachments</h2>\n\n<p>Hey surfaces attachments and looks to do a great job of this.</p>\n\n<p>I am sure that MailMate can do some kind of filtering based on attachment content, but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out a combination that would get this to work effectively<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">4</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>However, SaneBox offers the option to connect to a cloud storage provider and save email attachments to a folder in that storage. Optionally, it can strip the attachments from the original email.</p>\n\n<p>I created a connection to OneDrive and now SaneBox is saving email attachments there. To enhance search even further, I&rsquo;m indexing that folder in <a href=\"https://www.devontechnologies.com/\">DEVONthink</a> which unlocks the myriad ways of searching and surfacing that DEVONthink offers, while keeping everything neatly in a folder structure.</p>\n\n<p>Fastmail also offers the ability to save attachments to its storage space. I chose OneDrive because I wanted sync to my local drive. OneDrive was the best option as I have the most storage with it, and I&rsquo;m off Dropbox now that their client has become bloat-ware. That&rsquo;s not to say the OneDrive client for Mac is good - it isn&rsquo;t. If only iCloud Drive was an option&hellip;</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"stickies-notes-and-renaming-threads\">Stickies, Notes and Renaming Threads</h2>\n\n<p>Hey has me beat here. I haven&rsquo;t identified a way to create notes against single emails. However this has never been a problem for me in the past. I use a combination of OmniFocus/Drafts/NotePlan to make notes and this is working for me.</p>\n\n<p>The renaming of a thread is nice too, but again, not something I&rsquo;ve ever felt the need for.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>In summary, I think Hey is great. I wish them every success. If it offered the ability to work with my existing infrastructure, I&rsquo;d be tempted. But as it is now the service isn&rsquo;t right for me.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the workflow is solid. By replicating the structure with the combination of tools that I already own/subscribe to I can benefit from the method of work, without the prettiness. I&rsquo;m okay with that.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">At least in my small nerd corner of the internet.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:1\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">I&rsquo;ve long intended to write a blog post about my use of Basecamp Personal.

Hey is a standalone service. Unlike a typical email provider it doesn't expose an IMAP interface which other apps can use. If it did this, it would probably lose all the pretty add-ons they have built into the system. Furthermore it doesn't allow the use of a custom domain. You get a nice `@hey.com` email address but you can't BYO a domain name. A key part of my email infrastructure is owning my domain and emails form a component of that. Moving to Hey would mean stepping away from that lovely setup. I like owning `@andrewcanion.com` and `@canion.me`.\n\nFor these reasons I quickly ascertained that Hey was not a product for me.\n\nThat's not to say that it doesn't have some clever workflows, and it does look pretty. I can't replicate the pretty, but in watching the [walkthrough demo by Jason Fried](https://youtu.be/UCeYTysLyGI) I was fairly certain I could replicate most of the functionality.\n\nSo to satisfy my own curiosity I worked with the products I already have - SaneBox and MailMate - to see if I could construct a Hey-style workflow.\n\nLet's step through the way I built my copy-cat workflow.\n  \n\n## Triage - Yes or No\n\nHey lets you select whether new users will be added to your inbox (they call it an \"Imbox\" but I'm not going there).\n\nI use SaneBox for this instead. It does the same sort of triage, using machine learning to determine whether a sender is important to you or not. If it thinks they are, it goes to your inbox. If not, it goes to an alternative \"SaneLater\" folder.\n\nI have enabled notifications only for email that lands in my Inbox, so that matches the 'quiet by design' feature of Hey.\n  \n\n## Focus & Reply\n\nWithin Hey, this is a neat bundle of messages that are tagged to be dealt with later, most ideally in a focused session of email. They sit as a little visual stack at the bottom of the window. I can't match the visuals, but I should be able to match the functionality with MailMate.\n\nI've created a new Smart Mailbox, named `Focus & Reply` that looks across All Messages, and filters as per these conditions:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/e34350c219.png\" alt=\"Focus reply\" title=\"focus_reply.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"211\" />\n\nNote the `keyword` designation. MailMate lets you apply keywords to any email. To make this easier, I've added a keywords toolbar to MailMate, and have it set to showing the two that are relevant to the Hey-style workflow. I have a magnifying glass for Focus & Reply, and a pushpin for Set Aside.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/b80bedc99b.png\" alt=\"Tags toolbar\" title=\"tags_toolbar.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"110\" height=\"33\" />\n\nNow, if I click the icon on any email thread, it is tagged accordingly. I've enabled a column to show the keywords, so an email might look like this - note the magnifying glass:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/cd3f94a454.png\" alt=\"Tag column\" title=\"tag_column.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"295\" height=\"22\" />\n\nNow only emails that I've tagged by clicking the magnifying glass will appear in the Focus & Reply smart mailbox.\n  \n\n## Set Aside\n\nIn Hey, Set Aside is designated for mail that you want to reference later. These emails are also taken away from the Inbox view.\n\nAs with Focus & Reply, I've set the pushpin tag to act as the determinant. Together with another Smart Search, I've got this group of emails configured as such:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/3c4bec0713.png\" alt=\"Set aside\" title=\"set_aside.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"211\" />\n\nBut to get the workflow where these are 'out of view' in my regular Inbox, I need to configure my Inbox view as well. So I've created an `Unread Inbox`, that works on a series of mailboxes and applies a condition to only show unread mail, as such:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/94d2368ef4.png\" alt=\"Unread inbox\" title=\"unread_inbox.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"211\" />\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/981abea5d7.png\" alt=\"Unread inbox conditions\" title=\"unread_inbox_conditions.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"299\" height=\"211\" />\n\nNow if I want to reference my Set Aside email, I can click the relevant Mailbox in the Sidebar.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/1ccb39ad53.png\" alt=\"Mailmate sidebar\" title=\"mailmate_sidebar.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"185\" height=\"260\" />\n  \n\n## The Feed\n\nHey uses a concept of The Feed almost like a social media scroll of email incorporating newsletters, advisories and all the other non-timely information we get via email.\n\nI created this with the help of SaneBox. All my `The Feed` smart folder does is show me the contents of the default SaneBox `SaneNews` folder. It generally knows what should go in there, and I can train it as I go simply by moving mail into that folder as I see fit. \n  \n\n## Paper Trail\n\nThe Paper Trail in Hey is for receipts, invoices, and other such transactional information.\n\nHere, I created a custom SaneBox folder to replicate this feature. As I get receipts and things, I will move a few into this email folder and SaneBox will quickly learn and take care of them for me in the future.\n  \n### Other Email\n\nFor now, I'm still using the `SaneLater` mail folder to catch other less-important email. Looking at Hey, it seems email can only go to the Inbox, The Feed or The Paper Trail.\n\nSo for now, I've either got more features, or more confusion. Yet to be determined which that is.\n  \n\n## People Pages\n\nHey has a concept of people pages where you can see everything that relates to a single individual.\n\nMailMate has me covered quite well here although it doesn't look as pretty as what Hey has achieved.\n\nYou will note from the image of my MailMate sidebar above that I have a `People Pages` folder. When I expand that, MailMate shows me a folder for each individual sender. Click any of those and only email from that person shows in the main window. The image below shows this, with disguised names for privacy reasons.\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/uploads/2020/3e068fc0f6.png\" alt=\"People sidebar\" title=\"people_sidebar.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"168\" height=\"265\" />\n\nWith that, I've got a focused view of each person as well.\n\n*2020-06-17: I have created [an addendum to this post](https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2020/06/17/addendum-replicating-heycom.html), providing some more detail as to how to create the People Pages smart mailbox.*\n  \n\n## Attachments\n\nHey surfaces attachments and looks to do a great job of this.\n\nI am sure that MailMate can do some kind of filtering based on attachment content, but I couldn't figure out a combination that would get this to work effectively[^4].\n\nHowever, SaneBox offers the option to connect to a cloud storage provider and save email attachments to a folder in that storage. Optionally, it can strip the attachments from the original email.\n\nI created a connection to OneDrive and now SaneBox is saving email attachments there. To enhance search even further, I'm indexing that folder in [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/) which unlocks the myriad ways of searching and surfacing that DEVONthink offers, while keeping everything neatly in a folder structure.\n\nFastmail also offers the ability to save attachments to its storage space. I chose OneDrive because I wanted sync to my local drive. OneDrive was the best option as I have the most storage with it, and I'm off Dropbox now that their client has become bloat-ware. That's not to say the OneDrive client for Mac is good - it isn't. If only iCloud Drive was an option...\n  \n\n## Stickies, Notes and Renaming Threads\n\nHey has me beat here. I haven't identified a way to create notes against single emails. However this has never been a problem for me in the past. I use a combination of OmniFocus/Drafts/NotePlan to make notes and this is working for me.\n\nThe renaming of a thread is nice too, but again, not something I've ever felt the need for.\n  \n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, I think Hey is great. I wish them every success. If it offered the ability to work with my existing infrastructure, I'd be tempted. But as it is now the service isn't right for me.\n\nYet the workflow is solid. By replicating the structure with the combination of tools that I already own/subscribe to I can benefit from the method of work, without the prettiness. I'm okay with that.\n\n[^1]: At least in my small nerd corner of the internet.\n[^2]: I've long intended to write a blog post about my use of Basecamp Personal. One day...\n[^3]: Gmail isn't actually free, as in beer, you know?\n[^4]: If anybody knows how to do this, please let me know. I welcome feedback.\n",

This was a foundation for self-improvement and growth.

Though there was a period when I was a teenager that I did pay a little more attention to the shoe world, and basketball shoes in particular.\n\n## Basketball Shoes\n\nThis was the era of Reebok Pumps and the original Air Jordans. When shoes were big and high tops were really high. Fluoro colours were cool. Modern design technology was getting started and companies were testing the limits.\n\nThe shoe I desired most during this era were the Nike Air Jordan V, in white. The blacks weren’t nearly as good. The white ones featured a silver feather inset on the side, and the way they had a thick side sole with some red flames just made them look brilliant. The mid-cut ankle made them look even more streamlined.[^1] These shoes were amazing.

A <a href=\"https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2019/10/23/blogvember-prompt-list.html\">full list of prompts</a> for the month is available.</em></p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always watching and playing sport. As a kid, I tried most sports that entered my world view. I can remember playing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>volleyball</li>\n<li>cricket</li>\n<li>basketball</li>\n<li>tennis</li>\n<li>football (Australian Rules)</li>\n<li>soccer</li>\n<li>baseball</li>\n<li>swimming</li>\n<li>athletics (I loved high jump, hated running)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The sports I really enjoyed were cricket and basketball. If I&rsquo;d had a better experience with cricket, I probably would have stuck at it longer. I loved bowling and would be happy doing it for hours on end.</p>\n\n<p>The sport I excelled at was basketball. I was an athletic white guy. I am 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; and was able to throw down some good dunks. Although my mates were always frustrated that I seemed happier firing from beyond the three-point line! I maintain I was ahead of my time - look at how the game is played now.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately basketball has taken its toll on my body. I&rsquo;ve got an ankle that won&rsquo;t bend properly, hips that are creaking, and knees that have lost their cartilage so they crack and pop as I climb stairs, misaligned fingers and a thumb that strains with the slightest effort.</p>\n\n<p>Despite all those injuries and the awareness that things are going to get worse, I wouldn&rsquo;t change anything. I loved playing basketball so much. For me it went beyond a sport; it was a lifestyle. I made so many friends; I have amazing memories of playing with some incredible players and I&rsquo;ve met some impressive people.</p>\n\n<p>The two most famous basketball people I&rsquo;ve met are probably Luc Longley and Phil Jackson.

A [full list of prompts](https://blog.andrewcanion.com/2019/10/23/blogvember-prompt-list.html) for the month is available.*\n\nI've always watching and playing sport. As a kid, I tried most sports that entered my world view. I can remember playing:\n\n- volleyball\n- cricket\n- basketball\n- tennis\n- football (Australian Rules)\n- soccer\n- baseball\n- swimming\n- athletics (I loved high jump, hated running)\n\nThe sports I really enjoyed were cricket and basketball. If I'd had a better experience with cricket, I probably would have stuck at it longer. I loved bowling and would be happy doing it for hours on end.\n\nThe sport I excelled at was basketball. I was an athletic white guy. I am 6'3\" and was able to throw down some good dunks. Although my mates were always frustrated that I seemed happier firing from beyond the three-point line! I maintain I was ahead of my time - look at how the game is played now.\n\nUnfortunately basketball has taken its toll on my body. I've got an ankle that won't bend properly, hips that are creaking, and knees that have lost their cartilage so they crack and pop as I climb stairs, misaligned fingers and a thumb that strains with the slightest effort.\n\nDespite all those injuries and the awareness that things are going to get worse, I wouldn't change anything. I loved playing basketball so much. For me it went beyond a sport; it was a lifestyle. I made so many friends; I have amazing memories of playing with some incredible players and I've met some impressive people.\n\nThe two most famous basketball people I've met are probably Luc Longley and Phil Jackson. Ironically, neither of these encounters came because I was a basketball player. Rather, they came about because my father-in-law was Australia's Ambassador to the United States of America and both me and those basketball celebrities were at a gala \"G'Day USA\" event.\n\nNow I'm transitioning to the next phase of my sporting life. I am watching my eldest boy try a variety of sports. To date, it seems he is enjoying cricket the most. I wonder what my younger kid will get interested in?\n",

I haven't yet figured out how to combine some kind of `chmod` or `chown` command within Hazel to get it to change permissions and then delete the files.\n\nIn searching for a solution on the web, I've only found [one other mention of the problem](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/373378/wifidiagnostics-files-filling-up-drive-even-with-logging-disabled).\n\nI have deleted all my wifi settings and rebuilt them. I have deleted a security profile I had. I have toggled the enable/disable diagnostics by option-clicking the wifi menubar icon to see if that might rewrite a `.plist` file. Nothing has resolved it to date.\n\nI think this must be an underlying bug in the wifi networking frameworks of Catalina, but that's above my pay grade.\n\nI hope it's resolved in a future update. For now, it's an annoying bug, and another indicator that Apple's software quality is not where it should be.\n",

It was a week of relaxation at the tail end of a year that has been pretty crazy, and a 2019 that we expect will be even more hectic.</p>\n\n<p>When you travel with kids, conversations can move in varied and interesting directions. Our 7-year old boy took a particular interest in the toilets that were installed throughout the hotel we were staying. The brand — <a href=\"https://www.toto.com/index.htm\">TOTO</a> — is one seen all over the world, but less so in Australia. He was enthralled by the features: from automatic flushing with infrared sensors, to in-built bidets. Even the design of the loos was novel to him. He was fascinated. Next he realised that TOTO had also been responsible for the all of the tapware as well. Incredible!</p>\n\n<p>As a responsible Dad, I kept the toilet banter going, egging him on to explain to me further what he loved about them. I tried to add some interesting educational angles as well. I suggested that as a Japanese company, TOTO probably took great care in their manufacturing processes. I explained how Japan was the cradle of modern manufacturing methods, and how the Toyota Production System changed the world. I&rsquo;m not sure he bought into my lesson on lean thinking, though. I will have to try again in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Over the length of our stay, our conversations escalated to the point where I suggested we contact TOTO directly to let them know what great work they were doing with their toilet design. He took to that idea! So we did it. My son wrote an email to TOTO Customer Service, noting how impressed he was with their toilets, and expressing his desire to have them installed in our house as well.</p>\n\n<p>I figured that would be the end of it. I didn&rsquo;t expect to hear back, or if we did, I assumed it would be a boilerplate response. After a few days, we did in fact receive a reply, and it was a wonderful, personal email from TOTO’s Senior Manager of Customer Service. In the email, she expressed gratitude for my son&rsquo;s kind words, and also offered to send him some tokens of appreciation if we could provide our mailing details.</p>\n\n<p>We replied, and for fun, included a photo of David and I enjoying ourselves in Bali.\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1114\" src=\"http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/cac9c9a6b5.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"639\" /></p>\n\n<p>A few more conversational emails bounced back and forth between TOTO and ourselves, and they asked if we could send a photo of David with his items once they arrived.</p>\n\n<p>Within the next few week, we received an express mailed package from TOTO in Atlanta, to us in Perth, Australia. Just this concept alone was enough to blow my son’s mind. As promised, we sent another photo back with David holding onto the gifts he had been sent, and this was acknowledged by TOTO with thanks.\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1115\" src=\"http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/4d3957e2e0.jpg\" width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" /></p>\n\n<p>I see two key lessons in all of this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Always embrace crazy conversations with your kids. They’re fun, and you never know where they might end up.\nGenuine customer service — not selling — is the key to building great brand equity. I might never buy a TOTO toilet. My son might never buy a TOTO toilet. But I think both of us will be TOTO brand ambassadors from this point forward. Not because we were sent some trinkets, but because we had a genuine human interaction. We connected with a person who was obviously engaged enough in their own job to engage positively with us. If that employee is happy, then the company must have something going for it, and that’s the kind of company I want to see succeed.</li>\n    <li>From a business perspective, customer service shouldn’t be about hitting sales targets or avoiding bad press. It should be about working to have people care about your brand.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So thanks TOTO, for bringing fun and joy to me and my son’s lives, and for making sure this particular Bali holiday will have a very strange and unique anchor memory.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I lean heavily on my diary to plan ahead, guide me through my days, and establish a rhythm to my life. The type of work I do has a tendency to drift towards haphazard if not controlled, so a calendar helps me establish and maintain order.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I’ve faced in more recent times is having an overabundance of calendars I need to refer to before being able to commit to something. In simpler times, if I had a gap between 9am and 5pm, it was available to be taken up by a meeting. With the added complexity of kids and a wife who has an even more complex and random schedule than my own, things have reached a point where I need to check about 5 different calendars before I could confirm if I <em>actually</em> had availability for a meeting, irrespective of whether there was a gap in <em>my</em> calendar.</p>\n\n<p>This year I made a personal pact to get better at managing this uncertainty. I’ve considered how I could build a system that works better for me and my family, while maintaining flexibility for my clients. Many of the methods I’ve adopted are not new ideas; in fact, some are a blast to the past when people used paper day-runners and had a personal assistant (secretary?) who would prepare things on their behalf. Alas, I have neither of those, so I have leveraged my skills in process design and automation.</p>\n\n<p>Following is an outline of my diary management workflow as it has developed to date. It remains a work in progress and I expect it will continue to change.</p>\n\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n\n<p>I started by establishing clear and non-negotiable days for which I was available for visiting and meeting with clients. I refer to these as “External” days. The remaining days were locked in as days to spent at the office - my “Internal” days.

				"content_text": "I lean heavily on my diary to plan ahead, guide me through my days, and establish a rhythm to my life. The type of work I do has a tendency to drift towards haphazard if not controlled, so a calendar helps me establish and maintain order.\n\nThe problem I’ve faced in more recent times is having an overabundance of calendars I need to refer to before being able to commit to something. In simpler times, if I had a gap between 9am and 5pm, it was available to be taken up by a meeting. With the added complexity of kids and a wife who has an even more complex and random schedule than my own, things have reached a point where I need to check about 5 different calendars before I could confirm if I <em>actually</em> had availability for a meeting, irrespective of whether there was a gap in <em>my</em> calendar.\n\nThis year I made a personal pact to get better at managing this uncertainty. I’ve considered how I could build a system that works better for me and my family, while maintaining flexibility for my clients. Many of the methods I’ve adopted are not new ideas; in fact, some are a blast to the past when people used paper day-runners and had a personal assistant (secretary?) who would prepare things on their behalf. Alas, I have neither of those, so I have leveraged my skills in process design and automation.\n\nFollowing is an outline of my diary management workflow as it has developed to date. It remains a work in progress and I expect it will continue to change.\n\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n\nI started by establishing clear and non-negotiable days for which I was available for visiting and meeting with clients. I refer to these as “External” days. The remaining days were locked in as days to spent at the office - my “Internal” days. These days are consistent every week, to help with that rhythm.\n\nWhen visiting clients a lot of time is lost in transit. By collating these visits into a fewer number of days, I reduce my transit downtime, and have the opportunity to fill those days more effectively.\n\nMy “Internal” days facilitate getting into a <a href=\"http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2018/06/in-flow/\">flow</a> state more often because they aren’t broken up by meetings and appointments. Again, a more productive outcome.\n\nFor calendaring, I rely on <a href=\"https://www.busymac.com/busycal/index.html\">BusyCal</a> on the Mac and <a href=\"https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone\">Fantastical</a> on iOS.\n\n<h2>Technology - WhenWorks</h2>\n\nMy next area of improvement was in the way I was booking the meetings with clients on my “External” days.

				"title": "Replacing Social Media",
				"content_html": "<p>I joined both Facebook and Twitter many years ago, when they were technical ideas, as opposed to advertising machines driven by algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the reason for joining in the first place was for me to reserve my namespace. Just like gold rushes of old, it’s always important to claim your username before somebody else jumps in before you and puts their stake in the ground. While Twitter and Facebook took off, I also had my namespaces at long-forgotten sites like Pownce, Myspace and Technorati.</p>\n\n<h2>The Halcyon Days</h2>\n\n<p>Over the following years, my engagement with Twitter and Facebook increased. Facebook was great for retaining connections with people I knew <em>IRL</em> while on Twitter I built a list of followers that I didn’t know, but whose insights and commentary I enjoyed. This ultimately revolved around my two greatest hobbies: basketball and the Apple IT ecosystem. From around 2011-2015 really were the salad days of these two services.</p>\n\n<p>The problem for them (not me), however, was that I wasn’t paying the bills. Nor were any of the other users. We know how this story goes. As per the trope, if you’re not the customer, you’re the product. There was a realisation that I was certainly the product - being sold as advertising fodder by these services that needed revenue to keep the lights on, and investors invested.<sup id=\"fnref-613-1\"><a href=\"#fn-613-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<h2>Addiction</h2>\n\n<p>Over time, these services added dopamine to my day. The nefarious social engineering tweaks they built to maintain my engagement were difficult to defeat. Likes, comments, shares, retweets. All these things built in a way that tries to make you feel like you are valued by your audience, but which are all just further measures to build an advertising profile of each of their human products.

				"content_text": "I joined both Facebook and Twitter many years ago, when they were technical ideas, as opposed to advertising machines driven by algorithms.\n\nPart of the reason for joining in the first place was for me to reserve my namespace. Just like gold rushes of old, it’s always important to claim your username before somebody else jumps in before you and puts their stake in the ground. While Twitter and Facebook took off, I also had my namespaces at long-forgotten sites like Pownce, Myspace and Technorati.\n\n<h2>The Halcyon Days</h2>\n\nOver the following years, my engagement with Twitter and Facebook increased. Facebook was great for retaining connections with people I knew <em>IRL</em> while on Twitter I built a list of followers that I didn’t know, but whose insights and commentary I enjoyed. This ultimately revolved around my two greatest hobbies: basketball and the Apple IT ecosystem. From around 2011-2015 really were the salad days of these two services.\n\nThe problem for them (not me), however, was that I wasn’t paying the bills. Nor were any of the other users. We know how this story goes. As per the trope, if you’re not the customer, you’re the product. There was a realisation that I was certainly the product - being sold as advertising fodder by these services that needed revenue to keep the lights on, and investors invested.<sup id=\"fnref-613-1\"><a href=\"#fn-613-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>\n\n<h2>Addiction</h2>\n\nOver time, these services added dopamine to my day. The nefarious social engineering tweaks they built to maintain my engagement were difficult to defeat. Likes, comments, shares, retweets. All these things built in a way that tries to make you feel like you are valued by your audience, but which are all just further measures to build an advertising profile of each of their human products. But it kept me coming back.\n\nMy usage continued to grow until a series of events made me question what the hell I was doing. Firstly, most of the Facebook people I realised I either saw in real life — which was much more satisfying — or I never saw them, and didn’t have space in my life to genuinely care about them.

				"title": "Take Time to Breathe",
				"content_html": "<p>Life can get overwhelming. Work to do, dinners to cook, kids to care for, relationships to tend. Trying to do it all can be fatiguing. I have found this to be particularly true over this current long school holiday break, where the presence of children and their needs are incessant, but the other parts of life still need to be managed.</p>\n\n<p>Trying to balance it all is not easy, and I don’t believe there is any magic bullet that will solve it all. There are only ever going to be 24 hours in a day. So I think the best response to the pressure comes down to 3 main things<sup id=\"fnref-429-1\"><a href=\"#fn-429-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Scheduling: maximising the efficient use of time.</li>\n<li>Accepting: there’s no such thing as perfection.</li>\n<li>Breathing: maintaining mental health through awareness of the bigger picture.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Scheduling</h2>\n\n<p>Planning and scheduling can ease the mental burden. By making an agreement with yourself to do certain things at specified times there is clear evidence that time is being utilised to effect and things are getting done. At these times there is no need to worry about all the other things that aren’t getting done in the moment because at least you are doing something.</p>\n\n<p>Personally this year I am trying to improve the structure of my scheduling. I am establishing days as either <em>internal</em> or <em>external</em>. Internal days are dedicated to working on the tasks I have recorded in OmniFocus, following the general <em>Getting Things Done</em> approach to task management. I will also use this time for internal meetings, planning and the like. External days will be available for me to get out on the road, visiting clients, following up business development opportunities, and networking.</p>\n\n<p>I have taken my management of External days one step further by setting up a <a href=\"https://calendly.com/\">Calendly</a> account. This service allows me to permit clients to book meetings with me directly, subject to my availability. Calendly knows the days I have set as External, and it knows when the slots I have made available are taken up, preventing them from being double-booked. Much time and effort was wasted last year mucking about with the to and fro of trying to coordinate meeting dates, so I hope this more automated approach will ease the burden.</p>\n\n<h2>Accepting</h2>\n\n<p>I am the type of person that wants everything to go just as according to plan. Of course, no plan survives first contact with the enemy. I have to accept the foibles of humanity and roll with the punches when things don’t go the way I wanted.</p>\n\n<p>This is why planning methodology has moved away from ‘waterfall’ to ‘agile’ — because nothing works as intended, so change the plan rather than pretending that perfection is about to occur.</p>\n\n<h2>Breathing</h2>\n\n<p>In the chase for productivity at the micro-level, it is easy to lose context. Really, in the grand scheme of things, it’s highly likely that none of what we are doing actually matters that much. Now, this is not me promoting nihilism, because what we do does matter to those in our circles. What I am saying is that there are going to be few times where there is not sufficient slack in the timeline to pause; to take a time-out. In this moment, <em>breathe</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Go outside, take a walk, talk to a friend, pray, meditate — just do something different and unrelated to the task. Taking a break will freshen the mind and offer an opportunity to perceive that larger context. The thing that was causing stress may suddenly not seem quite so significant afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, having a sound and stable mind will allow a focus on scheduling and facilitate acceptance of what can and cannot be achieved. It’s a virtuous circle.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn-429-1\">\nBecause any good list worth it’s salt has 3 things. Not 2, not 4.

I have found this to be particularly true over this current long school holiday break, where the presence of children and their needs are incessant, but the other parts of life still need to be managed.\n\nTrying to balance it all is not easy, and I don’t believe there is any magic bullet that will solve it all. There are only ever going to be 24 hours in a day. So I think the best response to the pressure comes down to 3 main things<sup id=\"fnref-429-1\"><a href=\"#fn-429-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Scheduling: maximising the efficient use of time.</li>\n<li>Accepting: there’s no such thing as perfection.</li>\n<li>Breathing: maintaining mental health through awareness of the bigger picture.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Scheduling</h2>\n\nPlanning and scheduling can ease the mental burden. By making an agreement with yourself to do certain things at specified times there is clear evidence that time is being utilised to effect and things are getting done. At these times there is no need to worry about all the other things that aren’t getting done in the moment because at least you are doing something.\n\nPersonally this year I am trying to improve the structure of my scheduling. I am establishing days as either <em>internal</em> or <em>external</em>. Internal days are dedicated to working on the tasks I have recorded in OmniFocus, following the general <em>Getting Things Done</em> approach to task management. I will also use this time for internal meetings, planning and the like. External days will be available for me to get out on the road, visiting clients, following up business development opportunities, and networking.\n\nI have taken my management of External days one step further by setting up a <a href=\"https://calendly.com/\">Calendly</a> account. This service allows me to permit clients to book meetings with me directly, subject to my availability. Calendly knows the days I have set as External, and it knows when the slots I have made available are taken up, preventing them from being double-booked. Much time and effort was wasted last year mucking about with the to and fro of trying to coordinate meeting dates, so I hope this more automated approach will ease the burden.\n\n<h2>Accepting</h2>\n\nI am the type of person that wants everything to go just as according to plan. Of course, no plan survives first contact with the enemy. I have to accept the foibles of humanity and roll with the punches when things don’t go the way I wanted.\n\nThis is why planning methodology has moved away from ‘waterfall’ to ‘agile’ — because nothing works as intended, so change the plan rather than pretending that perfection is about to occur.\n\n<h2>Breathing</h2>\n\nIn the chase for productivity at the micro-level, it is easy to lose context. Really, in the grand scheme of things, it’s highly likely that none of what we are doing actually matters that much. Now, this is not me promoting nihilism, because what we do does matter to those in our circles. What I am saying is that there are going to be few times where there is not sufficient slack in the timeline to pause; to take a time-out. In this moment, <em>breathe</em>.\n\nGo outside, take a walk, talk to a friend, pray, meditate — just do something different and unrelated to the task. Taking a break will freshen the mind and offer an opportunity to perceive that larger context. The thing that was causing stress may suddenly not seem quite so significant afterwards.\n\nUltimately, having a sound and stable mind will allow a focus on scheduling and facilitate acceptance of what can and cannot be achieved. It’s a virtuous circle.\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn-429-1\">\nBecause any good list worth it’s salt has 3 things. Not 2, not 4.

Despite the macOS ecosystem perhaps not being as vibrant as it once was, it is still served by a wonderful cohort of professional and hard-working developers. Even though I’ve bought their apps, I sometimes feel I owe them more because using their software is what makes using my Mac both fun and productive.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a long tail of apps I use beyond those included in this list. Yet these I have detailed below are those I used extensively in 2017 and that I value and enjoy. These are the apps that I would most miss if they suddenly went away.</p>\n\n<h2>1Password for Families</h2>\n\n<p>Online security is no joke. It’s easy to dismiss password hygiene as tin-foil hat material, but when you think how much of our lives are conducted online, I don’t want a veneer of security — I want an ironclad guarantee. 1Password guarantees I can have unique complex passwords for every site that I maintain an account. I have no idea what any of these passwords are. But I do know my password to unlock 1Password. After that, it’s nothing but <code>⌘-&lt;/code&gt; to long me in anywhere.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://1password.com/families/\">1Password for Families</a> | US$4.99 per month</p>\n\n<h2>OmniFocus</h2>\n\n<p>I’ve waxed lyrical about OmniFocus before. Without this app there is no way I would be able to keep all my balls in the air. As much as parts of its design frustrate me, and the pace of its development is glacial, it works. Every day it delivers value by making my life easier. There are sexier to-do apps out there, but OmniFocus is rock solid.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">OmniFocus Pro</a> | US$79.99</p>\n\n<h2>Launchbar</h2>\n\n<p>My wife doesn’t have Launchbar installed on her MacBook. So when I try to use it, I feel lost. After years of use Launchbar feels an extension of the operating system and is completely engrained in my muscle memory. I switched to Launchbar years ago after Quicksilver became unstable and I’ve stayed ever since. I know others swear by Alfred, but I’m definitely a Launchbar guy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html\">Launchbar</a> | US$29</p>\n\n<h2>Bear</h2>\n\n<p>I love this app even though I do have to work hard to find a truly worthwhile use for it. I definitely underuse Bear, but I really like it. For the emotional response, I’m keeping it in my list. But there is still a nagging feeling that between Apple Notes, Ulysses and DevonThink Pro, I really shouldn’t need this app. But it is <em>really nice</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bear-writer.com/\">Bear</a> | US$14.99 per year</p>\n\n<h2>Ulysses</h2>\n\n<p>My key authoring application in which I write blog posts, work reports and other bits and pieces. For report writing as part of my day job Ulysses has this year supplanted Scrivener. For my blogging, Ulysses has withstood challenges from Bear and MarsEdit. It is a wonderful writing app and I enjoy that I have access to it through my <a href=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/mxocq3b5\">Setapp</a> subscription. If I didn’t have Setapp, I would subscribe to Ulysses directly without a moment’s hesitation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ulyssesapp.com/\">Ulysses</a> | AU$54.99 per year</p>\n\n<h2>DEVONthink Pro</h2>\n\n<p>The archive. The place I keep all my reference, research and archival material. I don’t use it for all that it can do; for instance I don’t create documents in DEVONthink despite it having the ability to do so. But for archiving, storing and searching, nothing beats it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/devonthink-pro.html\">DEVONthink Pro</a> | AU$104.13</p>\n\n<h2>StockMarketEye</h2>\n\n<p>This is a cross-platform Java app, so it’s ugly as sin. It’s also about the only share market application available for Mac. Fortunately it works well and gives me all the information I need to track my portfolio.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stockmarketeye.com/\">StockMarketEye</a> | US$99.95</p>\n\n<h2>Reeder</h2>\n\n<p>I have never given up on RSS, even through the dark days after the Google Reader shutdown. I love the independent web and follow a range of sites religiously. On the Mac Reeder is the best way to do this.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://reederapp.com/mac/\">Reeder</a> | US$9.99</p>\n\n<h2>PDF Expert</h2>\n\n<p>PDF Expert has replaced Preview for PDF viewing and editing. Preview’s editing toolbars have always been inscrutable to me whereas PDF Expert makes sense. The bugginess that was introduced to the PDF engine in MacOS Sierra was the final nail in the coffin and ensured my switch to PDF Expert.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pdfexpert.com/\">PDF Expert</a> | US$65.99</p>\n\n<h2>BusyCal</h2>\n\n<p>While the native Mac calendar app has improved, I still prefer having more power and flexibility to manage my calendars. While Fantastical always gets the glory as the sexy third party calendar option, BusyCal blends in and does the job quietly and effectively. I use this app daily. Its ability to save and restore different calendar sets give me helpful insights into my scheduled life.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://busymac.com/busycal/index.html\">BusyCal</a> | US$49.99</p>\n",

MarsEdit is an app that I have always <em>wanted</em> to use, but never really have found a place for it. Now, with the new version released I thought I’d download it and give it a spin as part of the 14-day trial developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielpunkass\">Daniel Jakult</a> offers.</p>\n\n<p>Recently I have been writing blog entries in <a href=\"https://ulyssesapp.com/\">Ulysses</a>, which is great in that it uses iCloud for syncing and has clients for the Mac and iOS. So writing can be done anywhere. It also has a Wordpress publishing engine so I don’t need to mess around to get my words on the web. Finally, Ulysses uses a flavour of Markdown which I am becoming much more proficient in using. Of course, I also already have a licence for Ulysses as part of my <a href=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/mxocq3b5\">Setapp</a> subscription.</p>\n\n<p>MarsEdit is a much more traditional blogging platform. It defaults to rich text, it is Mac only, and it is more ‘feature rich’ than Ulysses. It offers a two-way connection to Wordpress, meaning it can download an archive blog posts in addition to simply publishing which is the limit of the Ulysses offering. With my current workflow, if I need to make an edit to a published post I have to go to Wordpress on the web and make the change. From that point on, my local copy on Ulysses is out of date; there is no concept of syncing - it just publishes. MarsEdit is fully sync-compliant so I can fix those pesky mistakes and maintain a single source of truth.</p>\n\n<p>I do wish it had an iOS application, though. I imagine its code base is too entrenched in the Mac world to easily transition it to iOS, but it would be great to have a synced solution. This is where Ulysses excels - I can pick up the writing from where I left off from any device.</p>\n\n<p>The other thing is typing in rich text. While ‘normal’ people prefer this (think users of Microsoft Word, which is rich text throughout) for blogging I do tend to prefer using plain text and Markdown. The code is apparent, I know what is happening, and it is easy to read. My experience with rich text transitions to HTML is that things go wonky. Of course, MarsEdit can edit in plain text and apply a Markdown filter, but it doesn’t seem like its natural mode of operation.</p>\n\n<p>As I write this, I have been stumped as to how to add a footnote without resorting to pure HTML. In Ulysses with Markdown, this is an easy thing to do.

The virus started out as what appeared to be the flu, but after I couldn’t shake the feeling of fatigue and general malaise for weeks after the flu symptoms ended I decided to go the doctor.

Beyond the physical problems it has been a struggle to establish mental focus and remain concentrated on a task. I have had periods of forgetfulness and an incoherent mind. Making this worse from a working perspective is that there are not any external symptoms of the problem. This can make it hard for others to appreciate the truth that I am struggling to function. In a consulting environment, it becomes hard to step away from work when there aren’t any visible health problems.</p>\n\n<h2>Managing customer expectations</h2>\n\n<p>The client-focused consulting work that I do is not particularly conducive to long periods of leave linked to sickness. My work is a conduit for the success of other people’s goals and I need to fit in with their operational timelines. I engage with companies on the premise that our work will be done in a timely fashion. Often I am fitting my work around other projects they have on the go so any delays I create can have other knock-on effects. To suddenly need to take a lengthy break because of an illness that is not visibly apparent - but is impacting my mental state considerably - is a difficult thing.</p>\n\n<p>Managing expectations in these circumstances is a challenge, because I don’t even know what I can promise in terms of timelines. The best I have found I can do is to be upfront and honest about the situation, and trust there will be a level of empathy from the client I am working with.</p>\n\n<h2>Managing self-imposed pressures</h2>\n\n<p>Even harder than managing the expectations of others are managing the expectations I place on myself. I’m self-motivated and I structure my projects and set deadlines to ensure I stay on track and maintain momentum. Having an illness that impacts my ability to meet these deadlines is a frustration that can tend to eat away at me.</p>\n\n<p>I worry that I’m letting others down, and the feeling of ‘falling behind’ is not one I like. I have to take time to remind myself that I can’t always work with maximum efficiency; that I’m a living being who will have ups and downs. I need to let go, give myself time to recover and be assured that I will be able to catch up at a later point.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, I just need to accept that stuff will just have to wait, and sometimes there is nothing that can be done about that.</p>\n\n<h2>Phone messages</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, a note on voicemail.

This is necessary because my local Mac hard drive is a relatively tiny SSD which almost always seems on the verge of filling up.</p>\n\n<h2>Local backups</h2>\n\n<p>I maintain a few local backups:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a Time Machine backup that is stored on my NAS.</li>\n<li>a <a href=\"http://shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\">SuperDuper!</a> clone of my MacBook’s drive.

If anything goes horribly wrong, I should be able to retrieve data from this location. Backblaze operates to ensure that my MacBook, and any locally attached drives, are backed up to their cloud storage, which includes all the data that is also stored across the cloud services such as Dropbox and OneDrive.</p>\n\n<p>All this might seem like overkill but there is no way that I want to risk losing data that I can’t get back. The little bit of effort, and the little bit of money to pay for the software and services I consider a worthwhile exchange for peace of mind.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn-284-1\">\nThis enables me to essentially achieve a backup of my NAS to Backblaze, a hack made necessary as they don’t support the backup of network attached storage.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-284-1\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

I wish I could ditch it, but I’m not entirely confident that moving these files to iCloud will work, so I continue to have it running.\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud is a service I’m not taking full advantage of because I still prefer the Lightroom Classic and managing photos from local storage.\n\n<h2>Local storage</h2>\n\nI have a Network Attached Storage for mass storage of data, which is primarily photos and video. This is necessary because my local Mac hard drive is a relatively tiny SSD which almost always seems on the verge of filling up.\n\n<h2>Local backups</h2>\n\nI maintain a few local backups:\n\n<ul>\n<li>a Time Machine backup that is stored on my NAS.</li>\n<li>a <a href=\"http://shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\">SuperDuper!</a> clone of my MacBook’s drive. If something goes wrong I can boot from this clone and run from that external drive, or recover files as necessary.</li>\n<li>a USB hard drive that connects to my Mac, and with the help of <a href=\"https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/overview.html\">Chronosync</a>, ensures that photos are copied from my NAS to this storage that is seen as a drive locally connected to my Mac<sup id=\"fnref-284-1\"><a href=\"#fn-284-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The last resort</h2>\n\n<a href=\"https://secure.backblaze.com/r/012t34\">Backblaze</a> is my backup of last resort. If anything goes horribly wrong, I should be able to retrieve data from this location. Backblaze operates to ensure that my MacBook, and any locally attached drives, are backed up to their cloud storage, which includes all the data that is also stored across the cloud services such as Dropbox and OneDrive.\n\nAll this might seem like overkill but there is no way that I want to risk losing data that I can’t get back. The little bit of effort, and the little bit of money to pay for the software and services I consider a worthwhile exchange for peace of mind.\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn-284-1\">\nThis enables me to essentially achieve a backup of my NAS to Backblaze, a hack made necessary as they don’t support the backup of network attached storage.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-284-1\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Parts <a href=\"http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/09/part-1-my-business-philosophy/\">One</a> and <a href=\"http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/10/part-2-my-business-philosophy/\">Two</a> are also available.</em></p>\n\n<p>On my <a href=\"https://andrewcanion.com\">home page</a> I call out my personal business philosophy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  Andrew's business philosophy is built upon the value of mutual respect, the skill to leverage process for continuous improvement, and the ability to ultimately achieve self-actualisation.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Self-Actualisation</h2>\n\n<p>My philosophical statement finishes with the rather grand sounding ambition of achieving self-actualisation. I will elucidate what self-actualisation is and why I consider it so important that I place it as the anchoring element of my philosophy.</p>\n\n<h3>Etymology</h3>\n\n<p>The concept of self-actualisation was brought into broad awareness when it was presented as the pinnacle of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Abraham Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Maslow&rsquo;s rationale was based upon the understanding that only after the more immediate human needs are taken care of, is there capacity to focus effort on what brings us satisfaction and joy.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  Maslow explicitly defines self-actualisation to be \"the desire for self-fulfilment, namely the tendency for the individual to become actualised in what he is potentially. This tendency might be phrased as the desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming.”<sup id=\"fnref-261-1\"><a href=\"#fn-261-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fortunately, in my country and its society there is a reasonable (but not guaranteed) chance to achieve the lower rungs of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy. This unlocks the potential to aim for and potentially achieve that final goal of self-actualisation.</p>\n\n<h3>Building a framework</h3>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t see self-actualisation as an end-point; as the win achieved at the conclusion of a life-long progression up the hierarchy of needs. I believe we can reach the point of self-actualisation early and often, but what it is represented by will change over time. As we move through the stages of our life, commencing with childhood, then into the teens, marriage, career building, parenting, middle age and senior citizenship, different experiences will facilitate the goal.</p>\n\n<p>The degree to which we are realising self-actualisation is likely to ebb and flow over time. Building a framework for our life that supports personal growth and improvement will help ensure a reasonable chance of reaching periods of self-actualisation even as we deal with the trials and tribulations thrown at as by life.</p>\n\n<p>Without a structure and a consistent philosophical and ethical approach to life to fall back upon in challenging times it is less likely that consistent self-actualisation will be achievable.</p>\n\n<h3>Measuring success</h3>\n\n<p>Society has a tendency to measure success by outward facing and tangible measures such as wealth, fame and status. I prefer to think about success as the achievement of one’s potential and the personal joy imbued from doing what makes us happy. Precisely what the activity is that delivers said joy will vary as we grow and change.

				"content_text": "<em>This is the final of a three-part series focused on explaining my business philosophy. Parts <a href=\"http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/09/part-1-my-business-philosophy/\">One</a> and <a href=\"http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/10/part-2-my-business-philosophy/\">Two</a> are also available.</em>\n\nOn my <a href=\"https://andrewcanion.com\">home page</a> I call out my personal business philosophy:\n\n<blockquote>\n  Andrew's business philosophy is built upon the value of mutual respect, the skill to leverage process for continuous improvement, and the ability to ultimately achieve self-actualisation.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Self-Actualisation</h2>\n\nMy philosophical statement finishes with the rather grand sounding ambition of achieving self-actualisation. I will elucidate what self-actualisation is and why I consider it so important that I place it as the anchoring element of my philosophy.\n\n<h3>Etymology</h3>\n\nThe concept of self-actualisation was brought into broad awareness when it was presented as the pinnacle of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs</a>.\n\nMaslow's rationale was based upon the understanding that only after the more immediate human needs are taken care of, is there capacity to focus effort on what brings us satisfaction and joy.\n\n<blockquote>\n  Maslow explicitly defines self-actualisation to be \"the desire for self-fulfilment, namely the tendency for the individual to become actualised in what he is potentially. This tendency might be phrased as the desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming.”<sup id=\"fnref-261-1\"><a href=\"#fn-261-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>\n</blockquote>\n\nFortunately, in my country and its society there is a reasonable (but not guaranteed) chance to achieve the lower rungs of Maslow's hierarchy. This unlocks the potential to aim for and potentially achieve that final goal of self-actualisation.\n\n<h3>Building a framework</h3>\n\nI don't see self-actualisation as an end-point; as the win achieved at the conclusion of a life-long progression up the hierarchy of needs. I believe we can reach the point of self-actualisation early and often, but what it is represented by will change over time. As we move through the stages of our life, commencing with childhood, then into the teens, marriage, career building, parenting, middle age and senior citizenship, different experiences will facilitate the goal.\n\nThe degree to which we are realising self-actualisation is likely to ebb and flow over time. Building a framework for our life that supports personal growth and improvement will help ensure a reasonable chance of reaching periods of self-actualisation even as we deal with the trials and tribulations thrown at as by life.\n\nWithout a structure and a consistent philosophical and ethical approach to life to fall back upon in challenging times it is less likely that consistent self-actualisation will be achievable.\n\n<h3>Measuring success</h3>\n\nSociety has a tendency to measure success by outward facing and tangible measures such as wealth, fame and status. I prefer to think about success as the achievement of one’s potential and the personal joy imbued from doing what makes us happy. Precisely what the activity is that delivers said joy will vary as we grow and change. Exactly what it is matters less than the feeling it provides.\n\nAt one point of my life, playing basketball delivered a feeling of self-actualisation. Then later it was finding flow in a work assignment. Now it is linked to experiences of successful parenting. I am sure it will be other things later. None of these achievements are important to others<sup id=\"fnref-261-2\"><a href=\"#fn-261-2\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> but that doesn't mean I am not being successful in my own right. If we are seeking external validation it will a frustrating and largely unrewarding experience, because that's not delivered with any regularity.\n\n<h3>The journey is the reward</h3>\n\nThere is no prize for 'winning life'. External plaudits cannot be the arbiter of a life well-lived. We have been gifted a single life which even at the most optimistic is probably going to span less than 100 years. Against the timeline of humanity we are but granted a short window of opportunity. To bring meaning and purpose to our time on the planet we may as well participate with an aim of achieving joy and self-satisfaction.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many symbols of success we collect along life’s journey. The true measure should be our own happiness and fulfilment. Recognising each day as a gift to be enjoyed and maximised is a path towards self-actualisation. Find your joy, wherever it may be.\n\n<h2>Bringing the philosophy together</h2>\n\nSo, ultimately, I like to think that in respect of my business philosophy:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Mutual respect will help avoid many worries, anger and pettiness that can derail us as we build a career and/or a business.</li>\n<li>Establishing a process for continuous improvement will free our mind to focus on truly meaningful work, rather than busy work.</li>\n<li>By adopting a respectful approach to others and having a focus on always getting better, a person can grow self-confidence, self-satisfaction and their enjoyment of life in its entirety, which will form a pathway towards achieving self-actualisation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn-261-1\">\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization</a>&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-261-1\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn-261-2\">\nApart from my kids, who at this point assign no value to this.

This can be the big, organisational processes that dictate how companies do things, like build a component, or undertake customer service, or issue a refund.

In software development, this is standard practice - managing versions and being able to compare code differences is a key element of development and debugging.</p>\n\n<p>More generalised process management can benefit from a similar approach. Make a change and see if it works. If things get better after the change, stick with it. If things get worse, revert the changes and try something different.</p>\n\n<h3>Process at a personal level</h3>\n\n<p>At a personal level I implement process management for my own work. I rely primarily on <a href=\"http://omnigroup.com/omnifocus\" title=\"OmniFocus\">OmniFocus</a> to manage standard operating procedures for projects that are repetitive in nature. I use project templates that enable a framework to guide work that is similar in nature.

				"content_html": "<p><em>This is the first of a three-part series focused on explaining my business philosophy.</em></p>\n\n<p>On my <a href=\"https://andrewcanion.com\">home page</a> I call out my personal business philosophy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  Andrew's business philosophy is built upon the value of <strong>mutual respect</strong>, the skill to leverage process for continuous improvement, and the ability to ultimately achieve self-actualisation.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Mutual Respect</h2>\n\n<p>To make progress in this world we need teamwork and co-operation. High performing teams are built around trust and respect for one another.</p>\n\n<p>Even in a competitive environment there can be mutual respect. If you are beaten by a better performer, there is value in recognising their success and then using that as motivation to improve your own performance. Winners should stay humble and respect the competition that may not have succeeded this time, but might get the better of them next time around. Staying humble helps build respect.</p>\n\n<h3>Managerial respect</h3>\n\n<p>If a manager wants to get the most out of their employees, I believe they need to demonstrate respect and understanding for those they are asking to undertake the work. Acting with respect will build trust in leadership. Without trust it is difficult to achieve anything great. Time and and focus will be lost to people questioning what ulterior motives are in play, what forces might be working against them, and how to move into a position to win. More time is spent focused on self-preservation than on achieving team success. In such an environment it is unlikely that the team will be high-performing.</p>\n\n<p>A manager who respects their employees is likely to create a team with better camaraderie, better stability and a desire to deliver great outcomes.</p>\n\n<h3>Employee respect</h3>\n\n<p>Employees need to understand that their managers may be seeing the situation from a different vantage point. After climbing the organisational tree, the view from that altitude often looks very different. Much like a general might take to an elevated vantage point to survey the field, a manager may have a perspective on things that can&rsquo;t be perceived at ground level.</p>\n\n<p>An employee needs to appreciate and understand that the manager is likely to be balancing multiple competing pressures, and have respect for that challenge confronting their manager. This respect through understanding will help both parties.</p>\n\n<h3>Respectful reciprocity</h3>\n\n<p>A manager and an employee; co-workers and colleagues; buyers and sellers; all of these relationships rely on mutual respect to operate effectively. Each is a participant in a process chain. Mutual respect is about working to make the life of others a little easier, and a little better. This establishes a positive reciprocal relationship. If somebody is respectful towards me it is likely I will treat them with respect in return. Everybody enjoys a better experience.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that demonstrating respect for colleagues is the foundation for all other elements of business. If you don’t treat others with respect, it’s unlikely you will go far. Others aren&rsquo;t likely to be willing to go out of the way to provide help and support if you haven&rsquo;t been respectful on the way through. Nobody gets to wherever they are alone. We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before. Acting with respect offers a chance for others to stand on ours.</p>\n",

				"title": "Internet Services Worth Paying For",
				"content_html": "<p>On the Internet there is a weird user expectation that everything should be free. Over the past couple of years I&rsquo;ve been bucking this trend and have determined that spending a bit of money on what is both a hobby and an integral part of my existence in our modern, connected world is something I&rsquo;m willing to throw a bit of money towards.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be the product; I want to be the customer. Paying money for a service to avoid my usage being a vector to sell advertising is a trade-off I am happy to make.</p>\n\n<p>The other nice thing about paying for services is that it facilitates access to genuinely useful customer support. As a paying customer companies tend to care a little more about ensuring satisfaction. Having problems solved by a system administrator instead of wasting my own time futzing about can make a subscription worthwhile. I value my time, and where money can buy time, I&rsquo;m in.</p>\n\n<p>I thought I&rsquo;d take a quick audit and look at the areas online where I am willingly paying money in favour of a free option.</p>\n\n<h2>Ciao Google</h2>\n\n<p>The biggest change was a move away from many Google services. While Google offers its GSuite as a paid option (and a pretty good one at that), I elected to go a different route.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always preferred native apps and have never loved the Gmail web interface. As a free service it&rsquo;s fine but if I&rsquo;m paying real money I don&rsquo;t want to be spending it on something I don&rsquo;t enjoy using.</p>\n\n<p>If I were an Android user, the Google situation might be more compelling. On iOS, however, there always seems to be a little friction between what Google wants and what Apple is prepared to give.</p>\n\n<p>So I bid adieu to Google, and took my business elsewhere.</p>\n\n<h2>My Paid Providers</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mail &amp; Calendars: <a href=\"http://fastmail.com\">Fastmail</a>. I evaluated Office 365, GSuite and Zoho when making the choice. I only wanted really good email and calendars; I didn't need online storage, office applications, and other bolt-on services. I like that Fastmail is an Australian firm and that it has a focus on standards compliance.</li>\n<li>Domain registration: <a href=\"http://zuver.net.au\">Zuver</a>. The little brother of VentraIP. It is a great no-frills option, and they were having a product sale when I signed up.</li>\n<li>Web hosting: <a href=\"http://ventraip.com.au\">VentraIP</a>. Another Australian company that offers great support service. Their servers are fast and I am provided a web hosting solution that is perfect for my needs.</li>\n<li>Personal finance: <a href=\"http://youneedabudget.com\">YNAB</a>. Our family is in the best financial position of all time thanks largely to YNAB. No arguments about money in our home! The cost of this service is a pittance compared with the value (both monetary and stress relief) it has delivered.</li>\n<li>Password security: <a href=\"https://1password.com/families/\">1Password for Families</a>. The best security is not even knowing your own passwords. I am totally willing to pay to ensure all my online accounts (plus credit card details, etc.) are unique, random and locked down.

				"content_text": "On the Internet there is a weird user expectation that everything should be free. Over the past couple of years I've been bucking this trend and have determined that spending a bit of money on what is both a hobby and an integral part of my existence in our modern, connected world is something I'm willing to throw a bit of money towards.\n\nI don't want to be the product; I want to be the customer. Paying money for a service to avoid my usage being a vector to sell advertising is a trade-off I am happy to make.\n\nThe other nice thing about paying for services is that it facilitates access to genuinely useful customer support. As a paying customer companies tend to care a little more about ensuring satisfaction. Having problems solved by a system administrator instead of wasting my own time futzing about can make a subscription worthwhile. I value my time, and where money can buy time, I'm in.\n\nI thought I'd take a quick audit and look at the areas online where I am willingly paying money in favour of a free option.\n\n<h2>Ciao Google</h2>\n\nThe biggest change was a move away from many Google services. While Google offers its GSuite as a paid option (and a pretty good one at that), I elected to go a different route.\n\nI've always preferred native apps and have never loved the Gmail web interface. As a free service it's fine but if I'm paying real money I don't want to be spending it on something I don't enjoy using.\n\nIf I were an Android user, the Google situation might be more compelling. On iOS, however, there always seems to be a little friction between what Google wants and what Apple is prepared to give.\n\nSo I bid adieu to Google, and took my business elsewhere.\n\n<h2>My Paid Providers</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mail &amp; Calendars: <a href=\"http://fastmail.com\">Fastmail</a>. I evaluated Office 365, GSuite and Zoho when making the choice. I only wanted really good email and calendars; I didn't need online storage, office applications, and other bolt-on services. I like that Fastmail is an Australian firm and that it has a focus on standards compliance.</li>\n<li>Domain registration: <a href=\"http://zuver.net.au\">Zuver</a>. The little brother of VentraIP. It is a great no-frills option, and they were having a product sale when I signed up.</li>\n<li>Web hosting: <a href=\"http://ventraip.com.au\">VentraIP</a>. Another Australian company that offers great support service. Their servers are fast and I am provided a web hosting solution that is perfect for my needs.</li>\n<li>Personal finance: <a href=\"http://youneedabudget.com\">YNAB</a>. Our family is in the best financial position of all time thanks largely to YNAB. No arguments about money in our home! The cost of this service is a pittance compared with the value (both monetary and stress relief) it has delivered.</li>\n<li>Password security: <a href=\"https://1password.com/families/\">1Password for Families</a>. The best security is not even knowing your own passwords. I am totally willing to pay to ensure all my online accounts (plus credit card details, etc.) are unique, random and locked down. It's peace of mind.</li>\n<li>Entertainment: <a href=\"http://netflix.com\">Netflix</a> and <a href=\"http://spotify.com\">Spotify</a>. I'm hardly a special snowflake here, right? Broadcast media is dead to me.</li>\n<li>Photo Storage: <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238\">iCloud</a> 50Gb. Apple has me over a barrel here. Despite maintaining local backups, the ubiquity of photos being available to all my devices is too good not to take up.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bits and Bobs</h3>\n\nI also pay for a few other subscription apps and online services but I don't consider them to be part of my \"infrastructure\" so am not going to list them all here.\n\n<h2>The Customer is the One Who Pays</h2>\n\nMoney makes the world go around. It pays employee wages, funds infrastructure acquisition and incentivises the implementation of new ideas. I'd rather be a direct customer paying my own way, and helping companies do good work than rely on the largesse of search and banner advertising to underwrite my online activity.\n\nWhile I pay the bills, I call the shots.

				"content_html": "<p>I’m not one for new year’s resolutions but at the beginning of this year I decided to try incorporating mindfulness meditation into my life. This was an idea brought about by a feeling that I was living life in a semi-permanent state of anxiety; feeling the pressure of the now and the next thing to be done that was sneaking up behind that. I figured that some mindful meditation might offer a way in which I could carve out some time to intentionally slow myself down and try to alleviate some of that perceived stress.</p>\n\n<p>To facilitate the practice of meditation, I found <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com\">Headspace</a>. After enjoying the free trial I subscribed to an annual plan. Since my purchase, I’ve also discovered (but haven’t tried) a free, Australian equivalent, <a href=\"https://smilingmind.com.au\">Smiling Mind</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As somebody who had never traversed the path of mindfulness and meditation, I had no idea what to do, how to do it, nor what to expect from it. The great thing about Headspace is that it assumes this is the case for its new users. The app provides a helpful introductory course that helps guide one into the technique and its potential benefits.</p>\n\n<p>For the first few months, I was intentional about carving out 10-15 minutes each day for the exercise. Within a couple of weeks I found it had a positive impact on my state of mind, and each day I looked forward to the time where I could intentionally sit and do nothing. However, life being what it is, after about five months I found I was going days without meditating, and the habit that had been forming once again dissipated.</p>\n\n<p>In the last few weeks, I’ve made another conscious effort to undertake a session of meditation each day and once again I am enjoying the benefits it confers. Now, heading towards the end of August, my total meditation time recorded in the Headspace app is at about 1,000 minutes<sup id=\"fnref-132-1\"><a href=\"#fn-132-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> which equates to a bit less than 17 hours.</p>\n\n<p>In these days of hyper-connectivity and a constant barrage of (often self-inflicted) interruptions, we are lacking quality time for ourselves. It’s hard to ‘unplug’ from the world. In response, taking a few minutes out of each day to dedicate to my own peace of mind seems a sensible investment. The greater sense of calm I feel after a mindfulness meditation session helps with focus thereafter and so the time ‘lost’ to the meditation activity is quickly made up through increased productivity. Plus, nobody is so important that they can’t be incommunicado for 15 minutes, especially me!</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn-132-1\">\nalthough some of those minutes belong to my kid who enjoyed listening to a session as he fell asleep at night.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-132-1\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

The great thing about Headspace is that it assumes this is the case for its new users. The app provides a helpful introductory course that helps guide one into the technique and its potential benefits.\n\nFor the first few months, I was intentional about carving out 10-15 minutes each day for the exercise. Within a couple of weeks I found it had a positive impact on my state of mind, and each day I looked forward to the time where I could intentionally sit and do nothing. However, life being what it is, after about five months I found I was going days without meditating, and the habit that had been forming once again dissipated.\n\nIn the last few weeks, I’ve made another conscious effort to undertake a session of meditation each day and once again I am enjoying the benefits it confers. Now, heading towards the end of August, my total meditation time recorded in the Headspace app is at about 1,000 minutes<sup id=\"fnref-132-1\"><a href=\"#fn-132-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> which equates to a bit less than 17 hours.\n\nIn these days of hyper-connectivity and a constant barrage of (often self-inflicted) interruptions, we are lacking quality time for ourselves. It’s hard to ‘unplug’ from the world. In response, taking a few minutes out of each day to dedicate to my own peace of mind seems a sensible investment. The greater sense of calm I feel after a mindfulness meditation session helps with focus thereafter and so the time ‘lost’ to the meditation activity is quickly made up through increased productivity. Plus, nobody is so important that they can’t be incommunicado for 15 minutes, especially me!\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn-132-1\">\nalthough some of those minutes belong to my kid who enjoyed listening to a session as he fell asleep at night.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref-132-1\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

				"title": "The Weekly Plan",
				"content_html": "<p>I consider the two fundamental resources in work planning to be:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>The calendar</li>\n    <li>The to-do list</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The calendar represents the hard landscape: events that are non-negotiable, time-based and require you to be doing a certain thing, at a certain time, at a certain place, possibly with another certain person. If it&rsquo;s in the calendar, it&rsquo;s a <em>certainty</em>. Calendar entries are commitments to yourself and possibly others.</p>\n\n<p>The to-do list is used to track tasks needed to be done to move the ball forward. The list is potentially filled with a lot of items that may not necessarily be linked with one another. They are commitments to yourself, but they are not tied to being done at a particular time and don’t generally require the involvement of others. I use <a href=\"http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/05/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a> for managing my task list, but it really doesn&rsquo;t matter what is used, as long as there is a trusted location to track everything to be done.</p>\n\n<p>As a general rule, I’m not a fan of putting tasks onto calendars. I think they are two distinctly different things that should exist in their own dedicated spaces. However, like any good rule, there are times when this rule should be broken.</p>\n\n<h2>Leveraging multiple calendars</h2>\n\n<p>The beauty of using modern electronic calendar systems is they support multiple calendars. The classic and most obvious application of this is creating seperate <em>work</em> and <em>home</em> calendars. In addition to these staples, however, it can be helpful to create a <em>weekly plan</em> calendar.</p>\n\n<p>Each calendar&rsquo;s visibility can be toggled on and off, depending on the needs of the moment.</p>\n\n<p>Using the <em>weekly plan</em> calendar can facilitate the addition of tasks onto a calendar view without gunking up your regular calendars that represent real physical events and commitments. This leads to the next step: time blocking and setting commitments for your future self.</p>\n\n<h2>Time blocking</h2>\n\n<p>The purpose of time blocking is to help establish a plan for a forthcoming period of time and build accountability for your time. The idea is to create work sessions that are linked directly to items on your task list. Transferring tasks to a calendar and applying estimated timeframes in the form of a timed calendar entry can help build a visual map of work to be done. Visualisation is a great tool to help identify whether your to-do list is realistically achievable in the time available. It can also help enforce urgency by indicating how potentially little time is available for meaningful work. Finally, it can be a reward system. If you get ahead of your schedule, you&rsquo;ve earned yourself some relaxation time, safe in the knowledge that you aren&rsquo;t falling behind!</p>\n\n<h2>My approach</h2>\n\n<p>I generally reserve the time blocking approach for when I have a lot going on, and I&rsquo;m starting to feel overwhelmed by it all. Ideally, at the start of the work week I will set aside half an hour, and look at my calendar of commitments. These are the scheduled events with other people that are locked in (usually weeks in advance) and that I need to fit all my other work around.</p>\n\n<p>The next step is identifying the tasks that represent the &lsquo;big rocks&rsquo; that I need to progress. What projects need to move forward this week? What are the tasks that need large sessions of time to get into a flow?<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Once I understand what time slots I have available for task-based work, I start creating related events on my <em>weekly plan</em> calendar, filling my days more completely. I need to take some care here though. I&rsquo;m not an automaton, so it is important not to schedule every last minute of time. Doing that is just setting myself up to fail. In any week, unexpected things are bound to arise and time will be needed for this stuff, in addition to the general administrative tasks of email, communications, management issues, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>With the weekly plan calendar populated and tessellated with my other calendars, I end up with a clear picture of my work week.

				"content_text": "I consider the two fundamental resources in work planning to be:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The calendar</li>\n\t<li>The to-do list</li>\n</ol>\n\nThe calendar represents the hard landscape: events that are non-negotiable, time-based and require you to be doing a certain thing, at a certain time, at a certain place, possibly with another certain person. If it's in the calendar, it's a <em>certainty</em>. Calendar entries are commitments to yourself and possibly others.\n\nThe to-do list is used to track tasks needed to be done to move the ball forward. The list is potentially filled with a lot of items that may not necessarily be linked with one another. They are commitments to yourself, but they are not tied to being done at a particular time and don’t generally require the involvement of others. I use <a href=\"http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/05/omnifocus/\">OmniFocus</a> for managing my task list, but it really doesn't matter what is used, as long as there is a trusted location to track everything to be done.\n\nAs a general rule, I’m not a fan of putting tasks onto calendars. I think they are two distinctly different things that should exist in their own dedicated spaces. However, like any good rule, there are times when this rule should be broken.\n\n<h2>Leveraging multiple calendars</h2>\n\nThe beauty of using modern electronic calendar systems is they support multiple calendars. The classic and most obvious application of this is creating seperate <em>work</em> and <em>home</em> calendars. In addition to these staples, however, it can be helpful to create a <em>weekly plan</em> calendar.\n\nEach calendar's visibility can be toggled on and off, depending on the needs of the moment.\n\nUsing the <em>weekly plan</em> calendar can facilitate the addition of tasks onto a calendar view without gunking up your regular calendars that represent real physical events and commitments. This leads to the next step: time blocking and setting commitments for your future self.\n\n<h2>Time blocking</h2>\n\nThe purpose of time blocking is to help establish a plan for a forthcoming period of time and build accountability for your time. The idea is to create work sessions that are linked directly to items on your task list. Transferring tasks to a calendar and applying estimated timeframes in the form of a timed calendar entry can help build a visual map of work to be done. Visualisation is a great tool to help identify whether your to-do list is realistically achievable in the time available. It can also help enforce urgency by indicating how potentially little time is available for meaningful work. Finally, it can be a reward system. If you get ahead of your schedule, you've earned yourself some relaxation time, safe in the knowledge that you aren't falling behind!\n\n<h2>My approach</h2>\n\nI generally reserve the time blocking approach for when I have a lot going on, and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by it all. Ideally, at the start of the work week I will set aside half an hour, and look at my calendar of commitments. These are the scheduled events with other people that are locked in (usually weeks in advance) and that I need to fit all my other work around.\n\nThe next step is identifying the tasks that represent the 'big rocks' that I need to progress. What projects need to move forward this week? What are the tasks that need large sessions of time to get into a flow?<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>\n\nOnce I understand what time slots I have available for task-based work, I start creating related events on my <em>weekly plan</em> calendar, filling my days more completely. I need to take some care here though. I'm not an automaton, so it is important not to schedule every last minute of time. Doing that is just setting myself up to fail. In any week, unexpected things are bound to arise and time will be needed for this stuff, in addition to the general administrative tasks of email, communications, management issues, and so on.\n\nWith the weekly plan calendar populated and tessellated with my other calendars, I end up with a clear picture of my work week. At any point of time I know what I can and should be working on. I know that if I stick to the plan I set for myself, I will be closer to my goals at the end of the week than I was at the beginning. It's a practical approach to personal accountability.\n\nThe overhead of doing this planning is not always worth the effort, but when lots is happening and it feels like control is being lost, this is a great way to reassert your plans and ensure that the important is not being overwhelmed by the urgent.\n\n<ol id=\"footnotes\">\n\t<li id=\"fn1\">Writing is a great example of this - you can't really do it for 30 minutes here and there; you need a solid chunk of several hours. <a href=\"#ffn1\">&#8617;</a></li>\n</ol>\n",

				"title": "Personal Kanban",
				"content_html": "<p><h2>What is Kanban?</h2>\nTraditional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board\">Kanban boards</a> are used in manufacturing and other production environments to help visualise the flow of work and bring to attention any potential backlogs or other issues that might impact upon efficiency or productivity. When I travelled to Japan a few years ago as part of a study tour on lean manufacturing, I witnessed all sorts of kanban boards in operation to help provide factories with necessary production information.</p>\n\n<p>The essential premise of a kanban board is to demonstrate the flow of work along the value chain of production. At the fundamental level, the kanban board starts with a column for ‘work to be done’, then one for ‘work in progress’, before the work task exits the value chain as ‘completed’ work. Visually, a simple kanban board will have these elements drawn as columns on a whiteboard with a series of sticky notes representative of each element of work. As the work progresses, the sticky note is physically moved along the kanban board.</p>\n\n<p>Kanban boards can be used more broadly than in just manufacturing environments. More recently, software development has adopted many of the processes and tools of lean manufacturing, including kanban boards, in the design and implementation of agile, scrum and other team-based development methodologies.\n<h2>Personal Kanban</h2>\nI have an interest in kanban at a more atomic level - that is, how can the use of kanban boards help an individual to understand and visualise their own personal workflow. For knowledge work, understanding where somebody is at with work projects and having a grasp as to whether the situation is under control, or at risk, can be hard.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve recently been reviewing my own productivity management system to see if I can better implement personal kanban myself, to help me understand just how much work I have at any one time, and how my own ‘backlog’ is looking.\n<h2>My Technical Implementation</h2>\nI <a href=\"http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/05/omnifocus/\">previously wrote about OmniFocus</a> and how that brilliant application keeps me on track. Into that I have now created some kanban contexts, and tied these to a kanban perspective.</p>\n\n<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_52&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;214&rdquo;]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52\" src=\"http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/723c520851.jpg\" alt=\"My OmniFocus kanban contexts\" width=\"214\" height=\"214\" /> My OmniFocus kanban contexts[/caption]</p>\n\n<p>This helps me work on my task list by seeing my backlog of items, seeing what is currently active, and being able to work on them to completion.</p>\n\n<p>While OmniFocus is excellent, one of its key weaknesses is reporting and data presentation. It helps manage work brilliantly, but it doesn’t do so well at providing context. Not a management report is to be seen, other than being able to create any combination of list.</p>\n\n<p>To help with visualisation, I’ve had to turn elsewhere. I have recently revised a few <a href=\"http://trello.com\">Trello</a> boards that I use to help visualise my workflow, simplifying the board design and ensuring there was a very clear ‘left to right’ flow. In the process of updating Trello, I investigated a few other online kanban boards (namely Kanban Tool and LeanKit) to ensure there wasn’t a better option for me, but the best experience remains Trello.</p>\n\n<p>My final step was to really nerd out by leveraging the hard work of <a href=\"http://1klb.com/about/\">Jan-Yves Ruzicka</a> who has built a Ruby library called <a href=\"http://1klb.com/tags/omniboard/\">Omniboard</a>. If you have the capability to install Ruby, and the MacOS developer tools, Omniboard can create a fantastic graphical presentation of your OmniFocus data. This is output as a single, stand-alone HTML file which can be saved to Dropbox and thereby made accessible from any device at any location.</p>\n\n<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_51&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;1163&rdquo;]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51\" src=\"http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/5576e5924d.jpg\" alt=\"OmniFocus data presented in Omniboard\" width=\"1163\" height=\"1144\" /> OmniFocus data presented in Omniboard[/caption]</p>\n\n<p>To fully automate the process, my final task was to have Keyboard Maestro executes a shell command to update the Omniboard file on a regular basis. This ensures I have a regularly updated personal kanban board based on the activity and progress I have recorded in OmniFocus.\n<h2>The Point Being?</h2>\nThe ultimate outcome of all this tinkering is that I now have:\n<ol>\n    <li>a tactical view of my to-do list in OmniFocus;</li>\n    <li>a visual representation of my workflow in Omniboard; and</li>\n    <li>independent high-level strategic kanban boards operating separately in Trello.</li>\n</ol>\nIf clarity of information is important to managing workloads, then I am now in a much better place than before implementing these changes. You may not wish to go this deeply down the rabbit hole, but I have found it any interesting exercise in designing a workflow system that not only helps me get stuff done, but let’s me see how much capacity I have to get more stuff done.</p>\n",

When I travelled to Japan a few years ago as part of a study tour on lean manufacturing, I witnessed all sorts of kanban boards in operation to help provide factories with necessary production information.\n\nThe essential premise of a kanban board is to demonstrate the flow of work along the value chain of production. At the fundamental level, the kanban board starts with a column for ‘work to be done’, then one for ‘work in progress’, before the work task exits the value chain as ‘completed’ work. Visually, a simple kanban board will have these elements drawn as columns on a whiteboard with a series of sticky notes representative of each element of work. As the work progresses, the sticky note is physically moved along the kanban board.\n\nKanban boards can be used more broadly than in just manufacturing environments. More recently, software development has adopted many of the processes and tools of lean manufacturing, including kanban boards, in the design and implementation of agile, scrum and other team-based development methodologies.\n<h2>Personal Kanban</h2>\nI have an interest in kanban at a more atomic level - that is, how can the use of kanban boards help an individual to understand and visualise their own personal workflow. For knowledge work, understanding where somebody is at with work projects and having a grasp as to whether the situation is under control, or at risk, can be hard.\n\nI’ve recently been reviewing my own productivity management system to see if I can better implement personal kanban myself, to help me understand just how much work I have at any one time, and how my own ‘backlog’ is looking.\n<h2>My Technical Implementation</h2>\nI <a href=\"http://www.andrewcanion.com/blog/2017/05/omnifocus/\">previously wrote about OmniFocus</a> and how that brilliant application keeps me on track. Into that I have now created some kanban contexts, and tied these to a kanban perspective.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_52\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"214\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-52\" src=\"http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/723c520851.jpg\" alt=\"My OmniFocus kanban contexts\" width=\"214\" height=\"214\" /> My OmniFocus kanban contexts[/caption]\n\nThis helps me work on my task list by seeing my backlog of items, seeing what is currently active, and being able to work on them to completion.\n\nWhile OmniFocus is excellent, one of its key weaknesses is reporting and data presentation. It helps manage work brilliantly, but it doesn’t do so well at providing context. Not a management report is to be seen, other than being able to create any combination of list.\n\nTo help with visualisation, I’ve had to turn elsewhere. I have recently revised a few <a href=\"http://trello.com\">Trello</a> boards that I use to help visualise my workflow, simplifying the board design and ensuring there was a very clear ‘left to right’ flow. In the process of updating Trello, I investigated a few other online kanban boards (namely Kanban Tool and LeanKit) to ensure there wasn’t a better option for me, but the best experience remains Trello.\n\nMy final step was to really nerd out by leveraging the hard work of <a href=\"http://1klb.com/about/\">Jan-Yves Ruzicka</a> who has built a Ruby library called <a href=\"http://1klb.com/tags/omniboard/\">Omniboard</a>. If you have the capability to install Ruby, and the MacOS developer tools, Omniboard can create a fantastic graphical presentation of your OmniFocus data. This is output as a single, stand-alone HTML file which can be saved to Dropbox and thereby made accessible from any device at any location.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_51\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1163\"]<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-51\" src=\"http://canion.micro.blog/uploads/2019/5576e5924d.jpg\" alt=\"OmniFocus data presented in Omniboard\" width=\"1163\" height=\"1144\" /> OmniFocus data presented in Omniboard[/caption]\n\nTo fully automate the process, my final task was to have Keyboard Maestro executes a shell command to update the Omniboard file on a regular basis. This ensures I have a regularly updated personal kanban board based on the activity and progress I have recorded in OmniFocus.\n<h2>The Point Being?</h2>\nThe ultimate outcome of all this tinkering is that I now have:\n<ol>\n \t<li>a tactical view of my to-do list in OmniFocus;</li>\n \t<li>a visual representation of my workflow in Omniboard; and</li>\n \t<li>independent high-level strategic kanban boards operating separately in Trello.</li>\n</ol>\nIf clarity of information is important to managing workloads, then I am now in a much better place than before implementing these changes. You may not wish to go this deeply down the rabbit hole, but I have found it any interesting exercise in designing a workflow system that not only helps me get stuff done, but let’s me see how much capacity I have to get more stuff done.\n",

YNAB completely changed my perspective on personal finance management.</p>\n\n<p>YNAB is all about giving jobs to the money you have on hand <em>right now</em>. You budget that available cash down to zero, then stop. You don’t live on the credit card float. You don’t plan to spend more than you have.

You suddenly realise how finite your cash supply is, especially after accounting for those recurring bills and putting money aside for the big annual bills<sup><a id=\"ffn3\" class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup>.

				"content_html": "<p>Following on from my thoughts about Setapp, and now having all this extra software choice in my life, is that I now have to confront the challenge of choice.<br /><br />For <em>many, many</em>, years I have been using <a href=\"http://omnigroup.com/omnifocus\">OmniFocus</a> to manage my life - keeping all my work and personal projects and tasks safe and sound. I was using OmniFocus before it was even an app - back when it was a series of OmniOutliner scripts put together by <a href=\"http://ethanschoonover.com\">Ethan Schoonover</a> to replicate this magical GTD (Getting Things Done) philosophy that had entered the world not all that long before. So I&#8217;ve got a long-term relationship with OmniFocus. I love it. But as with any relationships, there are hurdles and things that you really wish were different. I wish OmniFocus had graphical elements, like visual timelines and kanban boards. I wish it had better abilities as an information/document manager. I wish it would move away from the arcane view of &#8216;contexts&#8217; which in this modern, connected, mobile world are not nearly as useful as they were in David Allen&#8217;s 2001 world where he could walk to the park and suddenly not be able to answer email.<br /><br />So, Setapp has some alternative apps. One in particular, <a href=\"http://www.pagico.com\">Pagico</a>, looks nice. It has some interesting file management concepts. It has a visual timeline. Maybe I could get to like this? But, hang on, I have a decade of history with OmniFocus. The switching cost - not in dollars - but in time and effort is huge. OmniFocus has inertia, muscle memory and comfort in its favour. How can Pagico compete with that? So I&#8217;ve tried using Pagico, and it looks pretty on the surface. But underneath it feels a bit&#8230; <em>brittle</em>. The sync engine is weird and the mobile apps feel pretty terrible anyway. The interface seems slow. I am struggling to trust the app.<br /><br />Maybe I should just stick with OmniFocus&#8230;<br /><br />Okay, so let&#8217;s go with another choice. I&#8217;ve used Scrivener for many years and more recently have been using it heavily as the starting point for the report writing I have to do for my work, before it is transferred into a CMS or Word file. I like Scrivener, but it is big and heavy for what I need. So now, with Setapp, I have <a href=\"http://ulyssesapp.com\">Ulysses</a>. This is an app that I&#8217;ve followed but not ever felt compelled to buy since I had Scrivener already. Now, though, I can give it a chance.<br /><br />So I have to learn a new app, remember to always write in Markdown, and then hope that I can easily get the text <em>out</em> of Ulysses in a format that I can use it in for its final form. Yes, Markdown is great but bureaucratic government systems don&#8217;t grok it, okay?<br /><br />So I&#8217;ve got to deal with another app choice, and now potentially have my stuff spread across two different word processors. But, of course, I&#8217;ve built an ecosystem around Scrivener across macOS and iOS - but Setapp only gives me the macOS version of Ulysses.<br /><br />The list goes on, and I guess this is capitalism at its finest. There is never <em>the</em> tool to use. Wherever a successful product is built, others quickly join the party. This is not something that is limited to software - this happens throughout the economy. Some of these apps are really good, and some come with their own idiosyncrasies. My challenge is to decide which of all the flawed products, speaks most to me. Which of these apps has been designed most in the way that my brain works, and which have flaws that least often affect me? This is the challenge of choice. I think I might just need to look on the bright side, and realise that this is all just grist for the mill of a software tinkerer, indulging his hobby.</p>\n",
